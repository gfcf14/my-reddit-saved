In an unrelated yet ironic incident, Wrigley Field burns to the ground. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Suicides in Chicago jump 430%. One man leaps off of the Hancock building and lands smack on President elect Hillary Clinton, who is in town to \"pay some old debts.\" She dies on the sidewalk. Bill promptly retrieves his saxophone and moves to Vegas.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A terrified Tim Kaine resigns instantly, leaving Paul Ryan in charge. But Ryan's mind is in turmoil already. You see, he's a MASSIVE Star Wars fan, and he just returned from the Rogue One premiere. And the movie was absolutely <em>god-awful!</em> Dreadful in every way. The press reports are ticking in, \"The Movie That Ruined Star Wars\" &amp; \"Disney On the Brink of Bankruptcy\". Rotten Tomatoes gives the picture a score so low, the website crashes. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Paul Ryan is <em>distraught.</em> So distraught in fact, he is deemed mentally incapable of the presidency. He too resigns and returns home to Wisconsin, where he dies suddenly is a cheese-related mishap. The police rule his death an accident...But his family knows the truth. Paul couldn't live with the travesty he'd seen in theaters. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Now both political parties begin to flutter in utter confusion, and the American people are calling for a President to lead the nation! So the GOP calls up Trump tower to get ahold of their candidate, only to find out The Donald and Bill Clinton have been having a marvelous time together in Vegas. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So the GOP calls Nevada. And the news gets even worse: Donald J Trump has died of a heart attack. Turns out he overexerted his old ticker while chasing a handful of middle school girls around the penthouse suite. Bill Clinton is still alive, but MIA - last seen heading north into the desert, carrying nothing more than his saxophone and a grocery sack full of mushrooms.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Now it's nearly New Year's Eve, and every effort to fill the Presidency has crumbled. Orrin Hatch declined. John Kerry did the same, stating: \"3 Purple Hearts is enough decoration for one lifetime\", before he laid down for his afternoon nap.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>All hope seems lost. The clock strikes 11:50 PM EST, and two DNC leaders stand around a battered table, covered in papers. The room smells of stale coffee &amp; cigarettes. The fluorescent lights flicker dimly overhead. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The two stare into the pile of candidate resumes around them - every single one crossed through with a big red X. All was hopeless. America had weathered many storms, but even the powerful USA was no match for 2016.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Suddenly, one man grabbed the telephone on the table.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"These are desperate times.\" he said, \"We both know what we must do. It is the only hope we have left.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The other man simply nodded and dialed the number. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The phone rang for what felt like hours. Then, a woman answered the line. <em>\"Australian Golf Club, Tina speaking.\"</em> she said. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Information was exchanged and a private line was activated. Nervously, the DNC men checked the clock, 11:57 PM EST.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Then - finally - a voice came through the line. In a rapid-fire succession of words, the DNC men pleaded their case; begging and nearly weeping tears of despair. <em>You're the only chance we have left</em> they cried. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>When the men had extended their final pleas, there was a pause. The silence echoed through the room. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>An answer came then - softly, but direct. The DNC man nodded gently and hung up the phone. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Well?\" asked the other man, \"What did he say?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"He said...\" the man paused, \"He said he would do it.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Both men erupted then, dancing arm in arm around the room, throwing resumes and files to the heavens in a joyful parade. The clock boldly struck midnight, and 2017 was ushered in under falling sheets of paper and the gleeful song of two jubilant men, who had just rescued America from a bitter end.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nearly ten-thousand miles away in Australia, sitting thoughtfully on a stone bench, President Obama handed a telephone to a waiter. Joe Biden approached him, unsure and silent.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Well Joe,\" Obama said, \"Looks like we're headed back to Washington.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Sounds like a good time to me.\" Biden shrugged and cracked a beer, \"I was getting tired of these fucking bugs anyway.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Glad to hear you're on board, Joe.\" Obama smiled.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"But say Barry, I do have one question.\" Biden frowned. \"3rd terms are <em>illegal</em>, right? I want to save America as much as you do, but those dipshits in the House won't allow it, will they? Or since you were appointed, perhaps it is legal?? Can we really do this, Barry? Can we <em>really</em> save America?\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Obama stood, his eyes facing the sea. He drew a deep breath. Then he fastened his golfing glove tightly and turned to Biden.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Yes we can, Joe... Yes we can.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the love my friends.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5b3lhf/what_would_be_the_twistiest_twist_ending_to_2016/d9llppg/?context=3","type":"X"}},

For me it's bouldering, but whatever you find, start now. Do it at least 3 times a week. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Step 2: get your finances in order. Figure out how much money you're spending each month/week and on what. Do you really need to be spending that much money? Probably not. Cut the crap, if you want your life to improve your gunna need to work for it. (check out <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance\">r/personalfinance</a> if you need help getting started.) </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Step 3: now that you've started getting on track, it's going to get tough to maintain. Make it a priority to show up at (insert physical activity of choice here) on specific days. Even if you don't do it, Show up anyway. It'll help build the habit. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Step 4: talk to at least one person that also does said activity every time you go. This will help you to socialize and get better. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are two types of things in this world; thing you have control over and things you don't. Whenever you see a problem in your life you gotta break it down into those two categories. Then work on the ones you can affect change in, and forget about the others. This will help reduce stress in your life. Do your best to spend as little time at home as possible. When you are home, don't stop working. Start a project, or search for jobs, or work on your resume. Research companies near you, even if you've gotta start at the bottom. Shit happens to everyone, very few people have had easy lives. So either you work hard, or you stagnate. And stagnation is the ultimate attraction killer. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I say this because this is what was said to me two years ago, and it helped me kick my butt into gear.

Instead the dead are sorted into six \"houses of heaven\" based on the sins they chose. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We arrived first at the House of Lust. \"House\" is a misleading term. It was more of a camp, spread over acres and acres of lush forest. There was a white sandy beach (nude, of course) full of copulating couples. There were little cabins sprinkled all along the path, from which orgasmic moans regularly came belting out. Men with six pack abs and women with perky breasts strolled by without even noticing me and God. They only had eyes for each other, tickling and pinching each other with flirtatious giggles. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"What do you think?\" God asked as we passed a nineteen-way taking place in a pool of champagne. Little cherubs flitted overhead armed with mops and cleaning supplies, thankfully. \"Lust is our most popular sin.\" I eyed the supermodel-like figures of a couple passing nearby, and could easily see why. \"You can look however you want. Hell, you can be whatever gender you want. No fetish is too taboo, and no desire can be denied here.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It was quite tempting, but I wasn't ready to make a permanent decision here. \"Let's see the others,\" I told God. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We carried on to Greed. We passed rows and rows of mansions, each more opulent than the next. Some of them were so large that they would have had enough bed rooms to fit my entire hometown. And so many different styles: one second, we were in a beautiful French vineyard in front of a gorgeous chateau with the Alps in the background. The next second, a warm tropical beach with a modern mansion atop breathtaking cliffs. After that, a ski chalet in Colorado with a roaring fire in a hearth large enough to fit an ox. Each one had various Italian sports cars and Rolls Royces parked in front, with the occasional smattering of boats, helicopters, etc. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Any material desire you ever wanted,\" God explained. \"Your own world, where you can have everything. You want the Hope Diamond? You can fly to Washington DC in your own solid gold helicopter and buy it from the Smithsonian. Hell, you can just buy the Smithsonian.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Also tempting, but I decided to keep looking. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Gluttony was next up. Tables and tables of the very finest foods: beautiful steaks cooked medium rare; butter-poached lobster tail; fresh oysters on a half shell; exotic wines in dusty bottles that had been hiding in the cellars of the world's finest restaurants. Everyone had a glass of champagne in hand and simply lounged on couches and chairs near the tables, eating endlessly. As soon as the inhabitants took a bite, the food just instantly came back. My mouth watered even watching them. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"In every other House, the food is practically sawdust compared to Gluttony,\" God explained. \"You haven't truly experienced heaven until you've been to Gluttony.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I shook my head, and we kept moving. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sloth was as you'd expect. An endless sea of the softest mattresses, stacked with cushions and pillows that made the story of the princess and the pea seem minimalist. Little angels visited each resident, giving them massages that made them all melt into their blankets. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Wrath was... well, a lot like what I'd expect Hell to be like. Fire, brimstone, whips, torture.. you know, the works. Except here, you weren't the one being tortured. Every enemy you'd ever made in your real life was now under your thumb. \"Lots of people choose their fathers,\" God explained. \"Lots of grudges against parents in general, you know. But you're not limited to that. Someone beat you out for a big promotion back on Earth? Take your pound of flesh here.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Then we arrived at Envy. It looked... well, a lot like home. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Go on in,\" God said, gesturing toward the door. I turned the knob and walked in... and found Emily waiting inside. She ran forward, wrapped her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss right on my lips. \"Welcome home, honey.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I looked back toward God. \"Oh, don't be coy,\" he said. \"You have no secrets from me. We all know that you were in love with your best friend's wife.\" She didn't seem to hear him at all; she went back into the hall. \"We all know that you just settled for your own wife while secretly pining after her. Well, this is your chance to live happily ever after.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I peered into the kitchen. Emily was baking something, wearing nothing but an apron. Her curly black hair fell softly over her shoulder as she whisked ingredients. She turned back, noticed I was observing her, and an enthusiastic smile spread across her face. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?\" God whispered in my ear. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I wanted to take it. God damn did I want to take it. But I shook my head. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>God seemed puzzled. \"You need to make a decision,\" he told me. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I haven't seen Pride yet.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He scoffed. \"No one ever wants Pride, trust me.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Well, I want to see it.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pride was boring. Just a row of workbenches in a bare white room. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I don't get it,\" I told God. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Yeah, no one does,\" he answered. \"That's why no one ever chooses it. Doesn't cavorting in Lust sound better than sitting here building little trinkets for the rest of eternity? Wouldn't you rather gorge yourself in Gluttony? Or spend time with Emily in Envy?\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I considered the options again. \"I pick Pride,\" I finally told him. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He narrowed his eyes. \"What? Look at it!\" He gestured around the room again. There wasn't much to look at. \"Why would you choose this for the rest of time?\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Because you don't want me to pick it,\" I told him. If he was really God, he'd know what a contrarian I can be. And I knew he was hiding something, trying to pretend like Pride didn't exist. There was something special about it. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>God scowled back. \"Fine.\" He led me over to one of the workbenches. In the center, there was a black space. A blank, empty void that went on forever. \"Here's your universe,\" he said. \"You've got seven days to get started.\" He took his seat at the bench next to me and went back to tinkering in his own world. After a long pause, he finally spoke again: \"You know, it might be nice for me to actually have some company for once.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT: Thanks to <a href=\"/u/Stamboolie\">/u/Stamboolie</a> and <a href=\"/u/shmameron\">/u/shmameron</a> for getting the source for the story and the original writer of said story. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The author is <a href=\"/u/Luna_LoveWell\">/u/Luna_LoveWell</a>, check out her other short writes.

This happens pretty frequently when men call to talk about genital issues, and we try to accommodate, but there weren't any men working that evening. I assured him that I could deal with whatever he needed to discuss.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I was very, VERY wrong.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The man says that he is afraid he might have an STD, as his penis was red and swollen. So I ask about other symptoms, and if he has been having unprotected sex.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Patient: \"Yes...but not with a woman\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me: \"Well, you can get an STD from sex with men or women...\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Patient: \"WHAT?!? I'm not gay! I don't sleep with men!\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me: <em>throughly confused</em> \"Ok sir...were you using a toy?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Patient: \"No, it was a female. Just not a woman.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me: <em>even more confused and a bit scared</em> \"Ummm...Sir, could you tell me from who or what you suspect you got an STD?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Patient: \"Well, you see, ummm...My wife left me last month, and I've been really sad and lonely, and I have this chicken...\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me: \"A chicken? A live one?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Patient: \"Yes, a live chicken, from the coop in my backyard. She's just so fluffy and soft, and I'm so lonely...I had sex with her. And now I have an infection, and I'm so ashamed...\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me: \"Oh. Wow. Ok. Well, uh... I don't honestly, um... I don't know if there are STDs which can be shared between humans and chickens. Let me make you an appointment for tomorrow morning...\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Turns out, he didn't have an STD.

The main thread was deleted, but I found another posting of it here: <a href=\"https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=145453251\">http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=145453251</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Below is a quick snapshot of the body language part. You can click the link if you want a quick rundown on ways to approach women as well.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<hr>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If a girl ever catches you staring at her, DO NOT BREAK EYE contact, but instead smile and wait for her to break it or smile back. This displays confidence. A good way to know if you flattered her or if she thinks you're cute is she does a hair twirl right after you do this. This displays insecurity and nervousness, she's wondering if she looks good enough for you. If you catch her preening or sitting with good posture, that is also a good sign. If she smiles back at you, this basically is an invitation to go up and try to introduce yourself to her.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Other good tips are to break into her personal space often in the flow of conversation. An easy and non creepy way to do that is to tap her forearm whenever she tries to make a joke or you agreeing on something strongly. Researchers have even shown that if you touch a girl on her arm lightly when introducing yourself, women were almost twice as likely to give out their number (srs). </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Probably the most important thing during conversation is to put in the right amount of eye contact, especially during intimate moments. As long as you don't overdo it, this signals sincerity, and also causes the human brain to release endorphin, literally causing the person to feel in love. Once again this is backed by science, and a common way for compulsive liars and sociopaths to establish trust.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>My personal favorite body language trick though is something I call the up down up though. When in the middle of a conversation right after you make her laugh establish eye contact with an amazed grin. Try to look like what you are seeing is the most beautiful woman on the planet. When she catches this look, look down for a split second and pretend to blush nervously like a \"oh shoot you caught me thinking you're beautiful\" look, then right immediately make eye contact again with a cheeky smile. Serious, this makes bitches melt.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4wum65/what_things_would_be_taught_in_flirting_101/d6a4ok1/?context=3","type":"X"}},

There were 3 out of 4 residents there when a good looking tall and charismatic blonde dude gave us some shady bullshit about being from a security company. He had a fake business card (with a \"blue shield\" and everything), but <em>really</em> insisted on coming inside to give us a \"free assessment\" about crucial break-in points for burglars (ie, the perfect sting for this fucking prick).</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>First and foremost, call out behind you like you had just heard your \"roomate\" or wife call out. Respond overly loud and interrupt their spiel with \"No, honey, just salesmen, keep the boys in the room.\" (If you're actually smart/a survivalist, talk this plan out in code w your roomie/SO so they know to call the cops <em>immediately</em>...or get roomates, tho glad you had a dog)</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Secondly, <em>ask for proof of employment</em>. The good ones keep a single fake business card (and ask for it back when you ask if you can keep it, like this fucking asshat did), but just assure them that you're calling their employer. Close the door on them. Lock it.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Third, call the police / your landlord. Ours <em>specifically asked</em>, \"is it some blue eyed, blonde haired guy, above 6', good looking? Yeah, call the cops. This creep has been in my neighborhood for years, picking off houses. Stall him.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He knew exactly what was up when he saw my roomate on the phone and we opened the door again. But honestly, you need to learn to parent. Which means keeping a poker face for immense, assumed lying. They just claimed that your neighbor bought some mags? You ask, \"really, who? Was it the (fake name) Johnsons next door? Can I see their purchase order?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The key point in all of this is that <em>you owe a stranger at your door abso-fucking-lutely nothing</em>. Close and lock the door the <em>second</em> you get a bad feeling in your gut and call out, loudly, \"Honey, call the police\". Describe the visitors abrasively and loud. If they're actual salesmen, yeah, slimy, but they have credentials. They <em>literally</em> have nothing to worry about if that's the case.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There's a huge difference between rude and stupid.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT: I <em>REALLY</em> must harp on my final point. Especially because burglars and scam artists are some of the smartest, quickest thinking scumbags in the world, you <em>must know</em> that they scour message boards/feeds like this for their pregame strategy. More importantly, OP might be trying to vet a sting right now by posting this. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I don't take issue, if it's on a reddit board, it's likelier that more good hearted people who genuinely want a LPT about the subject will use this info for good. But, again, I <em>must</em> insist: </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>TRUST YOUR <del>GUT</del> INSTINCT</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If someone makes you feel unsafe on the fucking <em>doorstep</em>, you'd be <em>insane</em> to trust them to stand there another minute and get a peek inside. Imagine if you were in your car. If someone refuses to leave/walk away from your car door after knocking on the window, <em>drive away. Protect yourself. Call someone.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT2: Shout out to <a href=\"/u/garycarroll\" rel=\"nofollow\">/u/garycarroll</a> for reminding me - this is a very smart thing for parents to do as well. My single father had to have others pick us up from school or other functions from time to time, so he made <em>sure</em> that <em>only we</em> all knew (dad, bro and I) a codeword to ask of someone we didn't immediately recognize and named us and our dad out loud.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT3: Thanks, <a href=\"/u/twy3440\" rel=\"nofollow\">/u/twy3440</a> for another tip <em>ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN/SMALLER TARGETS</em>: if you're ever walking in a densely populated area or the shady part of town, carry your keys individually between your fingers (like wolverine spikes). Twy's example of women getting raped in industrial areas around corners reminded me of the time my stepmom recounted living in Venice Beach in the 80s. Her dad gave her this tip and, unfortunately, one night some goon lunged out of an alley, grabbing her by the hair and pulling her into darkness. She swung blindly. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>She said the only thing she remembers from that night was his screaming as she ran to safety and pulled chunks of skin from her keys.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT4: Two years plus I've been hoping for gold. Thanks kind stranger and Reddit, today feels like a lot of good</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT5: Getting a lot of comments on the key trick, saying it can cause a broken hand. First and foremost: I'll take a broken hand over a broken anus  (hymen) <em>any day</em>. Secondly, this trick was taught to my stepmother who did not have a car. If you're walking to and home from work, smaller keys stay hidden and creep out between the knuckles, and unless you have a car key on ring it is very difficult to \"get the sharpest/longest one ready.\" Lastly, you aren't looking to shank a bitch but get away as quickly as possible. If someone grabs you from behind, swing around, aim for the face and neck, and continue to spin <em>out and away from your attacker and run</em>. Making a cock - back motion and driving downward will be easier to block for your attacker and if a solid jab goes deep enough, there's still the time it takes to pull it out. Which gives your attacker time to react and you with the decision of whether to leave your keys. I've never had this personally happen to me and I hope no one has to use it, but this is info coming from my stepmom (so it's likely outdated, but still applies to poor/college students rather than not having a plan)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/4qj2zg/lpt_request_how_to_legally_remove_a_stranger_from/d4tmgml/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Small actions triggering something massive?","content":"<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"A ship of Cuban immigrants sinking leads to America invading Iraq.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Such examples are common in history, but this is so vivid and unpredictable, that I have to mention it.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>November 21st, 1999, a boat carrying a dozen Cuban immigrants trying to get to Miami sank.  Two of the passengers were a young boy named Elian Gonzalez and his mother, Elizabeth.  Elian survived the sinking, but his mother did not.  If he had drowned, or if she had survived, most of us would never have heard of this story.  But he survived and was rescued by fishermen and brought to Miami.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At this point, the story becomes an international incident.  Elian was taken in by relatives in Miami, but his father still lived in Cuba, and wanted him back.  What would usually be a simple custody issue (which the father would almost certainly win), was complicated by 50 years of Cuban-American relations.  The large Cuban-American population in Miami has extremely negative feelings toward the Castro government in Cuba.  To them (including Elian's relatives), sending the child back to Cuba was unthinkable.  But the law pretty clearly gives parental rights to the father.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The US Government ordered that Elian be returned to his father.  Elian's American relatives refused.  The situation, while technically peaceful, was incredibly volatile, and could turn violent at a moment's notice.  The Border Patrol sent in an armed team to storm the house and taken Elian back by force.  No one was hurt, but armed government agents storming a home to seize a child played very badly in the media.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This incident gave then-President Clinton a serious political black eye, particularly among Cuban-Americans, which group is largely concentrated in Florida.  It just so happened that was an election year, and Clinton's vice-President, Al Gore, was running to replace him.  Clinton's political troubles ended up being passed on to his would-be successor.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The 2000 election was one of the closest in US history.  The US electoral system is set up so that whoever wins a state gets all the votes for that state.  Florida is a big state, and it's votes ended up deciding the election.  Al Gore ended up losing the state by an incredibly thin margin (in an election that remains highly controversial), which means that George W. Bush became the 43rd President of the United States.  It's highly likely that, had the Elian Gonzalez incident never happened, Al Gore would have been President.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The consequences of a presidential election are numerous, but there are some very clear ones in this case.  Less than a year into Bush's first term, the World Trade Center was destroyed by terrorists.  Both Republicans and Democrats agree that Gore would have responded different to the attacks (naturally, Republicans insist he would done much worse, Democrats insist he would have done much better).  Most obviously, while Gore might have still attacked Afghanistan, it's a near certainty he wouldn't have invaded Iraq.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So, had Elian's boat not sank, or had his mother survived, Saddam Hussein would still be in power, 4,500 Americans and 100,000 Iraqis would still be alive, several hundred billions of dollars would not have been spent, and ISIS would likely not exist.  At the same time, President Obama was elected primarily in response to the unpopularity of the Bush Administration, so there's no way of knowing who would be in the Oval Office now.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A single human death is more than a flap of a butterfly's wings, but the consequences of it are enormous.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-real-life-example-of-the-butterfly-effect\">Source</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4pscqa/what_are_some_examples_in_the_real_world_of_the/d4nh12s/?context=3","type":"X"}},

So 1836 is divisible by 9, 1936 is not. More exactly, a number and the sum of its digits both have the same remainder when we divide by 9. For example:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><p>3823 divided by 9 is 424 remainder 7. Also, 3+8+2+3 = 16 divided by 9 is 1 remainder 7</p></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><p>92838845 divided by 9 is 10315427 remainder  2. Also, 9+2+8+3+8+8+4+5 = 47 divided by 9 is 5 remainder 2.</p></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So if I want to know the remainder of a number after dividing by 9, I can just look at the remainder of the sum of its digits. They'll always be the same.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Now, remainders work nice under addition, subtraction and multiplication. If the remainder of N divided by 9 is 3 and the remainder of M divided by 9 is 2, then the remainder of N+M divided by 9 will be 2+3=5. If I add numbers, I can just add remainders. Same thing with subtraction and multiplication. Sometimes you might have to take an additional remainder, but it's good. For example</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><p>The remainder of 40 divided by 9 is 4, and the remainder of 55 divided by 9 is 1. The remainder of 40+55 will be 4+1=5.  So 40+55=95 has remainder 5 after dividing by 9.</p></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><p>The remainder of 43 after dividing by 9 is 7 and the remainder of 80 after dividing by 9 is 8, so the remainder of 80-43 after dividing by 9 is going to be 8-7=1. In fact, 80-43 = 37, which has remainder 1 after dividing by 9.</p></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><p>3823+92838845 will be divisible by 9 because 3823 divided by 9 has remainder 7 and 92838845 divided by 9 has remainder 2. So 3823+92838845 divided by 9 will have remainder 2+7=9. But 9 can't be a remainder, and 9 divided by 9 has remainder 0 so 3823+92838845 will have remainder 0, which means that it is a multiple of 9.</p></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In particular, if N and M have the same remainder after dividing by 9, then N-M will be divisible by 9. Their remainders are the same, so subtracting them will give remainder zero, which means that it must be divisible by 9.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you have a number, then reordering it's digits won't change the remainder after dividing by 9, because this does not change the sum of the digits. The remainder of 435 after dividing by 9 is the same as the remainder of 4+3+5=12, which is 3. The remainder of 354 after dividing by 9  is the same as the remainder of 3+5+4 = 12, which is 3. This means that 435-354 will have remainder 3-3=0, so it is divisible by 9.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So, because reversing the digits does not change the sum of the digits, the difference will always be divisible by 9.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The field of math dealing with remainders is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic\">Modular Arithmetic</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT: It works for 11,22,33 etc and palindromes, 313,2332 etc, because 0=0*9, which means zero is a multiple of 9.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4o9p15/why_is_that_when_you_subtract_a_number_from_its/d4arukj/?context=3","type":"X"}},

That experience alone changed my perspective on a lot of things, but one student in particular left a lasting impression on me and my life.   </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The story begins during my very first parent teacher conference night.  I spent a lot of time preparing individual student data, celebrations, concerns, pamphlets and baked goods.  It was a 7 am-7 pm workday, and I started it all pumped up.  This was one of those days I've anticipated and prepared for a while.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>6:30 pm rolls around and not a single parent has shown up.  After stuffing my faced with my own homemade white macadamia nut and chocolate chip cookies, I began angrily packing up my things and watched the clock as it slowly clicked to 7:00.  As I start walking out the portable to my car, I noticed a woman hobbling up the ramp.  She was mumbling and disoriented, but eventually told me she was \"Kid A's\" mother and was here for the conference.  My inner reaction to this moment has stuck with me every since.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At the time, I was angered.  I've spent the last 12 hours in that portable waiting for this moment.  In fact, I've been working towards it for years! High school electives, an Elementary Education degree, student teaching experience, etc.  No parent shows up, except this one...at the last second and, to me, appears drunk.  At the time, I was bitter, angry and resentful.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Either way, I held the meeting and discussed Kid A's academics and such. He was a very charismatic child who loved competition and sports.  His scores said he was performing on a Kindergarten reading level but he showed strength in mathematics.   Although he played the role of the \"class clown,\" he was respectful and caring towards others.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The mother ended the conversation very grateful that steps were put in place to strengthen his literacy.  Weeks went on and Kid A showed very positive gains.  The next month, he became very withdrawn and was falling behind in literacy, math and even gym.  I tried contacting his mother, but her phone was disconnected.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The day before the state test, the one that decides in 3rd grade if you continue onto 4th, his mother passed away. I found the next day that she was diagnosed with AIDS and died of complications.  Kid A was the one that told me...the day after her death.  He told his grandfather he wanted to go to school and be with his class. His eyes were red and puffy, but he played if off as if nothing happened. He took the test and continued the facade for a while. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>After some time we got the test results and he ended up failing. This meant that he would have to repeat third grade again the following year. The day he got the results, he asked if I'd have lunch with him. We ate together in the classroom and...now I'm crying...he broke down. He was beyond hysterical. He was just repeating \"Enough! Enough! Enough!\" I just held him and cried right by his side. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I ended up getting someone to sub my class for the rest of the day, while he and I walked and talked around the school. Not only did this kid lose his mother, but he didn't know his dad and was now living with his grandfather that he hated. \"Why can't you just adopt me?\" My heart broke. There is a light in this story. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We spent the entire summer working together and he grew a few reading levels (J-M). He was able to retake the test and ended up passing! When we got the results he looked up at me with watery eyes and said \"My mom would have been proud, right?\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>His story has changed my life forever.  Despite all the bullshit I have to go through as a teacher, I believe it's worth it.  It changed my perception of the world around me and myself. I'm far less judgey wudgey and give people the benefit of the doubt.  I will never forget \"Kid A.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2u0the/teachers_of_reddit_which_student_has_left_the/co4atrh/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Here's what's going on in the world at that date:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Mesopotamia:</strong> You've arrived right at the beginning of the Assyrian period. The Assyrians are brutal, and they have just brought down the Old Babylonain civilization. If you're not on their side, this is a particularly bad place to be. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Egypt:</strong> Sadly, you've just missed the height of the New Kingdom. The great pharaohs like Ramses II have recently passed away, and you're now in the middle of the Third Intermediate Period, a time of civil war and invasion. However, you will get to interact with the Nubian Dynasty, a brief period where black African Nubian kings conquered and controlled all of Egypt. This would be a fascinating time to observe. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Greece:</strong> Again, not a very good date here. The Minoan/Mycenaean civilizations have just ended following the conclusion of the Trojan War, but you're too early for Classical Greece yet. This is the \"Greek Dark Ages\", a period where civilization collapsed. Things will pick up again by 800 BC, but you'll have to wait a couple of centuries.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Rome:</strong> Rome doesn't exist yet, although you're in the very earliest beginnings of the great Etruscan civilization. Life here wouldn't be too bad. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>China:</strong>  You're in luck... you've hit the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty. This was a time of consolidation and advancement in China, although there's still quite a bit of warfare. China isn't unified yet, but the Zhou Dynasty was relatively advanced and well-run. This would be a good place to hang out for about three centuries. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>India:</strong> You've missed the Indus River Valley Civilization, but you're too early for the Mauyra Dynasty. If you're into Hinduism though, you've hit the middle and late Vedic era, so you could see some of the most important early developments in that religion first hand.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>North America:</strong>  The Olmecs are in decline and will still be around for a few more years, but the Maya are just beginning the Preclassic Period. Their great empire would be right at the beginning of its development. If you don't mind the heat, this wouldn't be a bad place to be either, minus the bloodletting rituals and human sacrifice. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>South America:</strong> You're WAY early for the Incas, but Chavin Culture is <em>just</em> about to emerge. It was a lesser known but equally important civilization in the region, and almost as expansive. They had just learned how to work gold and how to domesticate the llama. If you want your chance to dominate a reasonably advanced culture right at its start, this is your chance.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Anyway, these would be the places where most of the action would be going on in 984 BC. Most everywhere else would be either living in simple villages or not at a very advanced level of civilization yet.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>EDIT</em> - Since people are curious, I work as a college level professional historian.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Also...

Wolfenstein may have been the first major first person shooter, but Doom defined the genre for years to come.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Civilization:  Honestly, any of them, but I started with 1.  Another genre defining title, and so much replayability, even now.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>StarCraft.  The best RTS, bar none.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Super Mario Brothers:  You don't understand how awesome this was for us back in 80-whatever, but trust me, this shit is groundbreaking.  Play the whole thing, no warp zones.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Super Mario 3:  Now compare with this.  This is pretty much the height of what the NES could do.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mega Man 2:  The best Mega Man game.  For the music alone, but also just a lot of fun, and hard as hell.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Zelda: a Link to the Past : The NES Zeldas were good, but this shit here?  This is an amazing game.  Huge for its time.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sonic the Hedghog:  The only reason the Genesis was even a thing.  This game was fun as hell.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Final Fantasy 6 and 7:  Both classics, but what's interesting is the differences between the two, as the technology jumped.  Although my personal favorite FF is 5, if you can find it.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Super Mario Kart 64:  To this day, you and 3 friends can kill a night playing battle mode over, and over, and over...</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Perfect Dark:  Some would say Goldeneye, which has it's nostalgia value, but the weapon design on this is pretty great.  Not just variations on machine guns.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City: The perfect balance between 3's simplicity and San Andreas's complexity, this is the GTA game you want to play.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Fallout 3:  I'd recommend Fallout 1 and 2 as well, but modern gamers would find them a little too slow I think.  Fallout 3 does an amazing job of capturing the desperation and darkness of the world, while still being hilarious.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Red Read Redemption:  Simply some of the best storytelling for an action game out there.  And beautifully done.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bioshock:  I'm not an FPS guy, but this game is a blast, and the story is amazing.  Another game that pushed boundaries, adding political commentary to an action game.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Portal:  It's a fun game, but the pop culture it has created is so ubiquitous, you pretty much have to play it now.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>*Edited for formatting</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4bry4y/which_video_games_old_or_new_do_i_need_to_play/d1bulfq/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Also note: a heat stroke is caused by their temperature being too high not by dehydration.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If someone hads a terrible headache and pain when they look up or down that's possibly meningitis.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If a sober healthy person suddenly zones out and starts acting like a zombie or unresponsive and dazed while still being upright that might be a form of siezure.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If your mouth tastes metallic, skin tingles, there's buzzing/crackling from nearby conductive/metal objects, or all of your <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2381677/How-know-youre-struck-lightning-Picture-brothers-hair-end-minutes-before.html\">hair standing on end</a> like in a movie/cartoon? You're probably about to be struck by lightning.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Is the local vegetation dead around a certain spot (incl mold/moss/etc)? There's probably a reason for that. Same goes for dead animals or animals avoiding something/somewhere.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Addendum thanks to <a href=\"/u/Doctah_whoopass\">/u/Doctah_whoopass</a>: Also if there's a sudden increase in animal and especially insect activity, particularly concentrated in a small area, you might want to avoid it. Might not be dangerous outright but it's probably not going to be pleasant for you to get involved with whatever's attracting everything.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Nature is pretty loud, if it's quiet there's a reason for that.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The same goes for social gatherings and public locations. If a large crowd's attention is starting to converge on something and you're not at something like a concert or speech <em>something</em> is going on and it might not be good.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Following that if a crowd starts getting too dense/packed together (more than 4 people per square meter/ie when you can't turn around freely anymore) <strong>get the fuck out</strong>. At that point it takes one bottleneck or person tripping for something called called <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3pcvfb/saudi_arabia_hajj_disaster_death_toll_at_least/cw5vxtm?context=1\">crowd crush or crowd collapse</a> to happen, and when it does people die. Travel sideways and diagonally to get out of the crowd.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Are (faint) red streaks following veins coming from any sort of cut or wound on someone? Hospital time, blood poisoning is lethal. Catch it early.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Edit:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Another important one <a href=\"/u/TokesMcSmokes\">/u/TokesMcSmokes</a> reminded me of:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The \"need to breathe\" feeling is caused by too much carbon dioxide, not lack of oxygen.

She too was raised in a Catholic family, but her parents were divorced and she was still a practicing Catholic.  I always used to poke fun at her religion and get into arguments with her, and debate her and my family over their stupid religion.  She always held strong and was patient with me and held firm to her faith.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>My future wife also had Rheumatoid Arthritis.  She was diagnosed in college and was on a cocktail of drugs just to keep her disease at bay.  I proposed to her in March of 2009.  As our relationship progressed, so did her disease.  In our 6 years we dated, she had already had 2 surgeries when she started having trouble with her right foot.  We used to play intramural kickball and football together and for a full year, she would have trouble walking after our games.  She chalked it up to joint inflammation.  Toward September of 2009, I remember her limping after I would drop her off and she finally had enough to the point where she went to her Rheumatologist and asked for some imaging.  When she got the results of the MRI back, she was missing 3 joints in her foot.  Now, I don't know about you, but I had a friend who had a bone spur on the ball of his foot once and he said it was like walking on fire.  My wife was playing sports on a foot without joints (bone on bone) and it wasn't until after she got the MRI back that she stopped playing - she is tough.  So, after the MRI, a surgeon recommended a triple arthrodesis of her talonavicular and subtalar joints in her right foot.  That was December 2009.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The surgery itself was \"easy\" compared the the pre and post op period.  In order to undergo the surgery she had to go off of all of her meds 2 weeks before hand (Enbrel, Prednisone, Plaquenil, Naproxen, Sulfasalazine, Methotrexate).  This daily cocktail is what kept her symptoms at bay and functioning like a normal human.  Now I told you how tough she was - playing sports on a foot with no joints.  Well, about a week before her surgery, after all of the drugs were out of her system, I saw my insanely strong and beautiful wife regress to a state that was horrifying.  She couldn't get out of bed in the morning because every joint was inflamed.  A walk from her bed to the bathroom took 15 minutes because she had to shuffle inch by inch over the floor.  I, and her mother had to help feed her, clothe her, and get her ready.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On the day of the surgery, she was crying because she was in so much pain, and I remember wheeling her into the waiting room holding ice on her hands just to try to bring her some relief while we waited for them to take her into surgery.  The surgery took place, but her suffering continued.  She was on bed rest for 2 weeks and non-load bearing for 3 months.  The first two weeks after the surgery were awful, her disease just inflamed her entire body.  She couldn't grip a spoon, all she could do was lay there in pain.  Even on Oxycotin (yes, the really powerful cancer pain med) and Percocet, her body was still in pain.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I remember sitting with her on New Years Eve, shortly after the ball dropped, and she was in terrible pain.  And I said, \"Ask God for help.  Don't you believe he will help you?\"  And she said, \"If he was really there, why would he allow me to be in so much pain?\"  Hearing her words broke my heart.  This beautiful girl of mine - so strong in body and mind - to be broken...</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I went home that night and I knelt down in front of my bed and I clasped my hands together and looked upwards and said, \"God, I love Kim with my whole heart - you can't let her suffer... please please please, if you are there, I am begging you to help her and give her peace.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The next morning, I drove over to my wife's house (she was still living with her mother) and went upstairs to wake her.  And I asked her \"How are you feeling?\"  She responded, \"I am feeling so much better today.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The difference from that moment and moving forward, was like night and day from prior to then.  I truly feel like God was showing me he/she was there and he/she listened to me.  I felt like I had rekindled a relationship with a force greater than me.  This force had responded and I wanted to continue to build on the relationship.  I slowly started praying more, but didn't go to church.  I didn't want to put constraints or rules around this newfound relationship.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A few months later - as we were preparing for our wedding - we had a meeting with the priest who was to marry us.  He asked if I had any questions about anything and I told him about my history and the fact that I hadn't been a practicing Catholic for years.  He said, \"well, how about you and I talk some time?\"  We scheduled a talk for a week later, and I gave him the whole history of me, my religion, my time as a non-believer, and my experience during my wife's recovery.  I said I didn't know what I believed and I didn't really like religion.  He gave me some of the best advice I ever received...</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He told me to take religion out of it... He said, focus on faith.  At its core, faith is a belief and relationship in something greater than yourself.  He said, like all good relationships, faith requires love, patience, and communication.  All major religions take different paths up the mountain, but ultimately arrive in the same place - a relationship with something higher than themselves.  Religion is just an expression of someone's faith.  Just like people have different ways to express their different relationships, religions are different ways of expressing people's relationships with their gods.  He encouraged me to meditate (something he said Western religions unfortunately put little focus on) and to LISTEN - not talk.  He said if we listen God will speak to us.  Most people just spend too much time talking.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He then read me the Beatitudes from the book of Matthew.  He said, I don't know about you, but that is a God that I want to have a relationship with.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So, after a lot of time listening I redeveloped a faith in God and Jesus Christ.  My life is much more enriched and fulfilling now - I don't feel empty anymore.  Most importantly, I continued to pray that my wife and I would be led to a cure for her.  After a ton of research and reading, we adjusted my wife's drugs to a new mix.  Her inflammation level in her blood has been undetectable for 2 years now.  Her disease is in remission.  We were recently blessed with a pregnancy.  We were so scared because we knew my wife would have to go off some of her drugs during the pregnancy.  Thankfully, she has been off of all of the drugs except for her new biologic (Cimzia) and she has had 0 symptoms.  Her disease is still in remission, her pregnancy has been a breeze, and all checkups show what looks like a normal, healthy, developing baby girl.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I don't preach to others and I don't promote my faith to others unless they ask.  I don't live a perfect life, but I don't pretend to.  My most core belief is to love God with my whole heart and the way I do that is by trying to love others.  I look for ways to help others and if I can't help, I at least try to avoid harming them.  I like to think that it makes God smile when he sees me doing that.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>TL;DR;  I reached out to God in my greatest love's time of greatest need, and I believe he answered.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:  Holy crap.  I left that response and went to bed and didn't expect it to get the attention it did.  Thank you to everyone who responded with kind words, warm wishes, questions, and insight.  Thanks to the beautiful strangers who gifted me gold.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A few things to address:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>My response was to OPs question about why I returned to religion.  I won't debate about how silly I am, how my God is cruel, etc</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Yes, I give thanks every day to her amazing surgeons, rheumatologist, modern medicine, science, and all of the gifted people who contributed.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Yes, I continue to pray every day.  First and foremost, I always give thanks for my blessings and ask that I never take them for granted.  I also ask for opportunities that I may share my gifts and blessings to help others and opportunities that I may show love to others.  The best way I can show my thanks is by helping and loving others.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>She had a nerve block in her leg for the first few days after the surgery, then she was on Oxy and Percocet for two weeks.  She was'tn allowed to go back on any RA meds for 6 weeks after surgery.  I believe her relief was divine providence.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>My priest is very pragmatic.  I feel blessed to have had my first discussion be with him.<br></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>I believe God works through science.  I am thankful for science and modern medicine!</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>I know my wife still has the illness, but honestly there were times it was so severe, I never believed she'd see any relief.  The drugs she is on put the disease in remission and our prayers have been answered.<br></li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Faith is a relationship and like all relationships there are going to be things you believe that you can't prove and no one can tell you any different.  Yes, I could be completely wrong about my beliefs, and I will never know until I die, but that is not going to stop me from believing.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>I don't know why some people experience things like this and others don't.  It does sometimes seem cruel why some people experience suffering.  Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?  I don't know.</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>I'll end with this line from Bruce Almighty...</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Bruce: How do you make so many people love you without affecting Free Will?</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>God: [snorts] Heh, welcome to my world, son. If you come up with an answer to that one, let me know.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/43rlw3/serious_atheists_who_have_become_religious_or/czkir3n/?context=3","type":"X"}},

No exceptions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>2) When your bro’s girlfriend inquires about his whereabouts you know nothing, always.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>3) You are only obligated to wingman for one bro per social event; after that, the bro is on his own.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>4) When a bro designates you as his wingman, you may not fail him. This is the most important role a bro may play for a bro. It is not be violated or debauched.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>5) You must always do whatever is in your power to stop a bro from soiling himself with a poor looking girl—unless the bro is able to stand up, look you in the eye, and articulate that he is to a decent extent sober. Then you are absolved of any responsibility.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>6) When a bro pays for all the alcohol for an occasion himself, this must be made known to all present and made out to be the greatest feat ever observed in human history. A bro may skip out on kicking in for beer if he has done this recently.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>7) A bro must always respect another bro’s car, house, and parents.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>8) Love thy father and mother. A bro will never ever get with a bro’s biological mother or sister. Stepsisters and stepmothers are fair game. This article is subject to the All's Fair Clause.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>9) When a bro is showing his bro’s his new ride, he is always required to open the hood and showcase the contents. All bros present are required to admire the content, even and especially if they know nothing about cars.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>10) When a bro asks a bro what he thinks of his girlfriend or date, a bro is always required to give an honest answer. The phrase, “I’d bang her” is off limits.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>11) A bro will never ever leave his bros without a ride. A bro must never be allowed to walk alone more than 2 blocks.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>12) A bro will never ask for gas money for a ride unless he truly is hard up, or the ride exceeds a distance of 20 miles.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>13) When gas money for a ride is offered, it may be accepted. Use your own bro-judgment to determine if you should accept.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>14) A bro shall never make another bro ashamed for hooking up with a girl. Even if she was truly nasty, a bro will make excuses for his bro. Example, “you were drunk so…”</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>15) If a bro is terrible at sports, excuses may be made, no matter how bad they are. Good bros will start to play worse so that their bro doesn’t look so bad. This clause is subject to nullification by extreme competition.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>16) A bro will never make another bro look bad in front of a target girl. Any such attempts should be swiftly punished by the designated wingman. Afterwards, the bro who infringed upon this rule may be confronted by the whole circle of bros.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>17) A bro will always ask around before taking the last of anything. If a bro should ask you if its alright, unless the need is great or direct ownership is applied, you will let him have it. Common courtesy and the bro code go hand in hand.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>18) A chick may be included in the bro code if she has proven herself worthy via general bro concession.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>19) A chick may never be informed of the sacred rules of the bro code. A chick may be treated as a bro but never told of the rules. When reprimanding a girl for an infringement of the bro code, say “its just common courtesy.”</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>20) A bro will never let another bro drive drunk. Space must always be found or made for a drunk bro who needs to leave. If necessary, the theft of phone and keys shall be done for his own good.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>21) A bro will never allow another bro to drunk dial or txt a girl. No exceptions to this rule. When a bro is truly smashed and his girl calls, the phone will be confiscated until a sober state of mind is achieved.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>22) If a bro’s girlfriend calls you and asks about a bros actions the previous night, (I.e. the bro claimed to be sleeping at a friend’s house) you will always claim that yes he was there and you may even claim he is still there. Studies show that 8 out of 10 bros will do this without thinking. The other 2 bros claimed he was still with them but unavailable to talk.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>23) You will always make excuses for a bros actions, no matter how obscene. All things done by a drunk bro must be forgiven. No exceptions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>24) A bro should always be allowed to make amends for his actions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>25) A bro will always give his bro’s girl a ride to wherever, so long as restitutions are made for the action.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>26) A bro will never give detail when describing a sexual encounter. Doing so will force your bro to imagine you naked and this is unforgivable.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>27) A bro will always do his best to help another bro’s self esteem. The Alpha-Bro should always be handing out the wisdom and power of his skill. A bro will always recognize the master seducer of the group.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>28) A bro should never ever under any circumstances sleep with a bro’s ex-girlfriend. A bro may proceed to make moves on another bro’s failed target (he got rejected) but only after asking permission first. If the bro declines your invitation to bust some moves, you must adhere to his wishes and find a new target.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>29) If permission for rule 28 has been given by a bro, and success is evident for yourself. One must always put it down to it being the girl’s preference and not due to your superior abilities. If a bro proceeds to become butt-hurt about your success where he failed, you are under no obligations to make him feel better or apologize for your success.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>30) A bro will always take care of a bro who is blacked out, throwing up, and incase parents or girlfriend call. If a bro’s parents demand he comes home immediately, one will immediately allow him to use a shower and whatever else is necessary to make sure a bro receives no enemy fire on the home front.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>31) A bro will always tell a bro what he did when he was blacked out. No matter how bad.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>32) A bro must always maintain a safe physical distance from a bro’s girl, especially when drinking. Physical contact may only be made with a bro’s girl, when saying good bye. No exceptions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>33) A bro will always do his best to stop a bro from getting tattoos. A bro’s skin is the largest organ he has and the second most important. Especially if the tattoo is of a girl. Chicks will dump you and play with your heart, but a bro will protect you like his own private parts.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>34) When a promise is made, it shall be kept. And under no circumstances shall it be broken.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>35) The way of the bro is sacred, cherish it like a sect or cult. The bro life is like being in Jedi training camp. You must always show your bro love and be joyous when bro love is shown to you.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>36) Bro-mance is allowed but only among your tightest bros. Never take your bro-mance too far. And if anyone should remark negatively upon your bro-mance. An immediate beat down should ensue. Should a girl comment negatively upon the bro-mance, kindly explain to her that she will never know love from a man such as you and your bros share. And let her know what a privilege it is to be a mere witness to your glory.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>37) The fist bump is a bro’s greatest weapon aside from the bro code itself. It should be used to show support, acceptance, pride, and it is an all around green light for an action that was committed. Use the fist bump often, and show constant appreciation for your bro’s jokes and skills with it.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>38) Corollary to rule 37, the denial of a bro’s fist bump is a terribly powerful slap in the face. To deny a fist bump is no light thing, and should only be done when there is very great disapproval of an action.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>39) Never refer to a bro by his last name, this is a sign of disrespect. Always refer to a bro by their name, nickname, or any standard bro word.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>40) Standard bro names include but are not limited to; bro, dude, man, and anything with bro in it. (example: broham.)</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>41) Always respect a bro’s viewpoints about anything from politics to cars to religion. The only time a bro’s views do not matter is when they conflict with the bro code. If such a case should happen, the bro should be immediately evicted from the bro circle, until correctional actions have been made.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>42) A bro should always treat for food when a bro is broke. Signs that a bro is broke are phrases like, “I’d rather eat at home”, “I’m not hungry”, “I just ate”, and finally “I’m trying to save money so ill eat at home.”</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>43) Similar to rule 42, when discussing the purchase of party beverages, if a bro declines to offer money. The other bros should cover for him. No bro should be denied thirst quenching goodness just because it’s a tight week or month.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>44) A good bro will always encourage his bros to be an Alpha-Bro when it comes to talking to girls. If necessary demonstrations of your prowess may be made to give your bros something to work with.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>45) A bro is only allowed to do really stupid things when he is really drunk. A bro may be denied further access to alcohol when it is obvious he has drunk too much already.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>46) All things must be forgiven among bros, with the exception being your drunk bro feels up your girlfriend. This allows for an immediate punch to the face, but only after all other bros have been told and are gathered to watch the punishment. Before the blow is delivered, your drunk bro must have the situation explained to him. Because he is drunk, he will probably agree that he needs to be punched.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>47) Under no circumstances should a bro ever be hit in the genitals for any reason. Ever.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>48) You should only ever make fun of a bro for minor things that don’t affect their physical attributes.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>49) The only time that cockblocking is condoned by the bro code is when the designated cockblocker (aka the bombardier) has viable reasons to stop a bro from hooking up with a girl.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>50) The Golden bro rule that everyone knows: <strong>Bros over hoes</strong>. This rule may be seasoned to taste by the bros themselves. Example; Bros over hoes except at the close.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Anyone who's actually debating these as if they're serious and not a circlejerk...needs to calm down.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/42xma9/reddit_what_are_some_bro_rules/czdvevi/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Number one priority for me was not looking homeless, and becoming <em>not</em> homeless as quickly as possible. Use community pools or a gym membership so that you can continue to shower/shave daily while looking for work or affordable living. Keep a clean set of clothes set aside for days where you land an interview. In case of inclement weather, tie plastic bags around your shoes. Keeping a cheap phone paid is a top priority. Use library internet for job listings, and also to find out where every available free source of food within are reasonable distance of you is. Do not fucking waste money on cigarettes, drugs, pop, junk food or alcohol when you don't even have a roof, every dollar will count. If you take meds for something then I hope they are cheap because you should keep taking your meds. Apply for social assistance, street allowance, free job training, <em>anything</em> your particular government has to help you. Career centres (which you should be going to) will have volunteer boards, sign yourself up to volunteer during weekends when it's harder to job hunt, often you will get a free lunch and you could make connections.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>All of the above advice is useless to the over 80% of homeless people who have severe head injuries or mental disorders, and will likely never be able to function properly in society.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3v9pxm/serious_homeless_people_of_reddit_how_would_one/cxlkqha/?context=3","type":"X"}},

What are things like now?","content":"<div class=\"md\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Back when I was 18 I worked for a large chain  drug store. I was barely getting by and was only being offered part time hours. After about two months of this, I decided I had to find another job because I wasn't making it. The day I was going to put in my two weeks,  a new manager that transferred from another store, started working at my store. I was scheduled to work with her that night and I would be giving her my two week notice. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So towards the end of my shift, the day had been a great day and the new manager was pretty awesome. I told her about needing to put in my two weeks notice and she kept trying to help me brainstorm other options. She talked me into waiting one more week before giving notice and the  gave me her number at the end of my shift.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The rest of that week I pretty much spent at her place testing the foundation of her house and trying to break her pelvis, figuratively of course lol. At the end of the week I come into work to see what my schedule was going to be for the following week, and I see that I have been scheduled for full time hours! </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I immediately call her and she tells me that she pulled some strings and got it approved. So two months go by and she starts to act a little crazy and can tell I'm about to leave her. This is where things got weird, I go to her place to fuck her one last time lol, and she suddenly starts telling me about her abusive ex and how she has been running from him. This man is also the father of her daughter. She then tells me she is afraid of him, and asks me if I would \"take care of him\" if he ever tried to hurt her again. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I don't respond, because I am taken a back by what she's told me, and then suddenly she blatantly asks me if I would kill him for her. I obviously get weirded out and start to leave which is when she tells me if I don't do it or I leave her, I'll lose my full time hours. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So making the responsible choice lol, I go into work the next day when she isn't working and I have a meeting with the store manager. I tell him that myself and her have been in a relationship and that I'm being forced to stay with her or she would take my full time. I then tell him about her request, and he tells me that he had heard rumors of her doing this before but there had been no proof. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So long story short the next week I come in, she has been transferred back to her old store and I am reassured my full time hours. I then find out she tried the same shit with another employee, who went to the police and she was later arrested for attempting to pay for someone to kill her ex, who in all actuality is a great guy and just wanted his kid back. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I kept my full time, went on to be a manager and was given first picks at any shift I wanted. I stayed there for about 3 years. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sorry for the long story, just didn't want to miss anything. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3q9u5l/serious_people_who_performed_sexual_favors_in/cwdcjuk/?context=3","type":"X"}},

She was beloved by most of her students - the female ones especially - but had a habit of being passive-aggressive and saccharine towards more difficult pupils. She'd find (or invent) reasons to ignore difficult questions, offer vague threats about impending punishments, or make small efforts to turn classmates against one another. She was not an especially likeable educator, and she became a truly reprehensible one when she insisted that Jupiter was bigger than the sun.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At first, it seemed like a misunderstanding. Our class had just entered into an astronomy unit, and one of our activities was to construct a scale model of the solar system. The reference image we used came from a picture book, and in it, the sun had been reduced in size. The teacher had not noticed this fact, and was therefore operating under the mistaken assumption that Jupiter was our largest celestial neighbor.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Well, I knew better, and I tried to correct her. She replied to me with a tone of aloof dismissal, stating quite clearly that I was wrong. \"That's okay, though,\" she said. \"After all, you're in school to learn new things.\" Then she smiled sweetly, and I returned to my seat feeling thoroughly confused and frustrated. In the weeks that followed, I engaged in an all-out war against my teacher's pseudo-science. My father, having heard everything from me, sent me to school with one of his college textbooks, hoping to turn the tide of the battle. My teacher refused to even look at it. \"Class,\" she said, rolling her eyes, \"who can tell Max what the biggest object in the solar system is?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>My face was burning with anger and shame as every other student shouted \"JUPITER!\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Things only escalated from there. I refused to back down, despite having been labeled as the class dunce. Each time the topic came up, I tried to offer my evidence... and each time, I was steadfastly opposed by everyone within earshot. Finally, after over a month of torment, our astronomy unit culminated in a field trip to the local planetarium. The show was a breathtaking adventure through our galaxy and the universe beyond, and it left me feeling infinitesimally small... yet strangely empowered. As the lights came up, our guide to the cosmos asked if there were any questions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Which is bigger,\" I shouted, jumping to my feet, \"Jupiter or the sun?!\" My entire class sighed in frustration, my teacher barked at me to sit down, and the astronomer looked thoroughly confused.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"The sun, of course,\" he scoffed.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A hush fell over the room. After a moment of utter silence, a girl named Melissa spoke up in a condescending tone. \"Well, sir, we have a chart that says Jupiter is bigger.\" The astronomer looked at her. He looked at my teacher. Then he looked at me with an expression of sympathy.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Little girl,\" he said, returning his attention to Melissa, \"if you look at the picture again, you'll see that the sun is being shown at a fraction of its actual size. Otherwise, it wouldn't fit on the page.\" His gaze moved to his next victim, who had slumped down in her chair so as to be almost as small as her students. \"Your teacher should have told you that.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Upon returning to our classroom, all the students crowded around our reference book. Sure enough, a tiny block of text explained that the sun had been scaled down in the illustration. I declared my triumph, having finally been vindicated. Nobody apologized, my teacher found new reasons to punish me, and I was treated with no small amount of scorn, but I didn't care. From that day forward, I knew to never be afraid of asking questions, nor of standing up for facts in favor of fiction.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>From that day forward - at least until it was taken away - I proudly wore my homemade dunce cap with a smug grin.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>TL;DR: My third grade teacher was a space-case.</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3pnbm4/who_was_the_worst_teacher_you_ever_had/cw7reey/?context=3","type":"X"}},

As I approached the center, it seemed like I was joining a universal consciousness; a being made up of the thoughts, emotions, and experience of everyone and everything that had ever lived.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I'm sure it was all just a hallucination brought on by the trauma I had suffered the few days combined with my heart/breathing stopping, but there's a part of me that hopes that what I saw is what really happens when we die.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3fc1h8/redditors_who_have_died_and_then_have_been/ctn8uu9/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Well worth a read.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out \"for my safety\" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like \"this country is going to hell in a handbasket.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time is money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow...</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>But we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is \"Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor\" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>tl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won't be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my 2010.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/elal2/have_you_ever_picked_up_a_hitchhiker/c18z0z2\">Original Comment. </a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3c90bj/whats_the_nicest_thing_a_stranger_has_ever_done/cstfn3b/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Begin preaching. Quickly get pegged as another loon by city authorities, who've dealt with plenty of others like him. His insistence on speaking in ancient Aramaic gets him placed in a mental hospital. Eventually, just as he begins to crack, a sympathetic Christian Arab who speaks a dialect of Aramaic becomes fond of Yeshua ben Yusuf. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dr. Bassam is increasingly intrigued by Yeshua. He's very unlike most of the other victims of \"Jerusalem fever.\" His calloused hands and feet, his lined and tanned skin speaks of years in the sun - and yet he speaks flawless Aramaic, as well as rudiments of Latin and Greek. His idiom is rough, his vocabulary rude, but he speaks with gentle authority. He has <em>charisma</em>. The other patients gravitate to him, and the staff give him the run of the place. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dr. Bassam observes Yeshua in the woodworking shop, delighted if terrified by the power tools, a firm competent hand with axe and plane and hammer. Yeshua crafts a stool. Its lines are graceful and strong. Yeshua works with the grain as if he can hear the wood whispering to him. It is unfinished, rough-edged, and yet it bears any load. Yeshua sits upon it, closing his eyes as he sits in a sunbeam, entering through a barred window. For the first time, Dr. Bassam lets himself hear the thought which has been murmuring inside his mind for months. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"This is Jesus Christ, King of Kings.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yeshua looks over. His smile is easy, warm. It is the smile of a killer, and of a child. It contains and surpasses whatever emotion Dr. Bassam can summon. Behind it are motivations which Dr. Bassam cannot calculate or predict. He cannot get ahead of this patient. He is not insane. He is not a man. He is a god. He is God. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yeshua lays his strong hand upon Dr. Bassam's shoulder. \"You believe,\" he says, his tongue awkward around the modern Hebrew he has been learning. \"But believe I am man. I am son of God, and son of Man. I show way.\" He switches back to Aramaic. \"You are a man of this time. You will doubt. When the sun sets, in the cold-lit darkness of these days reason will whisper to you that I am mad. That you must... fix me.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I will not, Lord.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yeshua's smile becomes simpler, truer. The terrible joy and fierceness that shone through is hidden. \"For now we are two brothers. Let us not talk of the future. Let us, as one heart, enjoy the fruit of the day.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dr. Bassam stands in a locked room, with a madman. He leans into the beam of light and smiles.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>edit:</strong> I do this sometimes. <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/prufrock451\">/r/prufrock451</a>. thank you.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zh3nf/what_would_jesus_actually_do/cpiuorn/?context=3","type":"X"}},

This lets to start with a fresh slate. From there, install your drivers and the most basic apps you use. Firefox, Chrome, Steam (but not all your games), etc. You want things that you absolutely know you will use but you don't want to fill up a ton of storage space.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>At this point, don't install anything else. Instead, make an image of your computer. There is a ton of free software that does this and they are very easy to use. I use Hiren's Boot CD to run miniXP to make my images. Save the image on an external hard drive. Now if you ever get a bad virus, or your HD fails, or your computer gets so jammed full of stuff you just want to start fresh, you can just revert to your old image and already have Windows + your basics installed. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can even keep multiple images if you have the space to store them. I keep one that's just Windows and a few simple things and save it as Fresh Slate. I then do another one after I've installed Steam, my go to core games (CS:GO, WoW, few others), and I've loaded some music and other things. I call this one Full Install, and I have the option to revert to it if something ever goes wrong. Peace of mind and hassle free if something ever goes wrong. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Edit: Thank you whoever gilded me!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zgqvh/what_is_something_you_think_everyone_should_have/cpiyir5/?context=3","type":"X"}},

For some reason, I attract these people into my life.  I don't do anything super extraordinary.  I am not famous.  But I count many peoplewith ultra high net wealth among my close friends and I have spent more time than even I can believe with 8 different billionaires.  This is not just meet-and-greet time.  This is small group and even one-to-one time.  I dated the daughter of one billionaire several decades ago.  So I have gotten a peek into this life.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Let's get one thing out of the way.  There are gradations of rich.  I see four major breaking points:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Worth $10mm-$30mm liquid (exclusive of value of primary residence).  At this level, your needs are met.  You can live very comfortably at a 4-star/5-star level.  You can book a $2000 suite for a special occassion.  You can fly first class internationally (sometimes).  You have a very nice house, you can afford any healthcare you need, no emergency financial situation can destroy your life.  But you are not \"rich\" in the way that money doesn't matter.  You still have to be prudent and careful with most decisions unless you are on the upper end of this scale, where you truly are becoming insulated from personal financial stress.  (Business stress exists at all levels).  The banking world still doesn't classify you as 'ultra high net worth'  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Net worth of $30mm-$100mm</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>At this point, you start playing with the big boys.  You can fly private (though you normally charter a flight or own a jet fractionally through Net Jets or the like), You stay at 5 star hotels, you have multiple residences, you vacation in prime time (you rent a ski-in, ski-out villa in Aspen for Christmas week or go to Monaco for the grand Prix, or Canne for the Film Festival--for what its worth, rent on these places can run $5k-20k+ per NIGHT.), you run or have a ontrolling interest in a big company, you socialize with Conressmen, Senators and community leaders, and you are an extremely well respected member in any community outside the world's great cities.  (In Beverly Hills, you are a minor player at $80 million.  Unless you really throw your weight around and pay out the nose, you might not get a table at the city's hottest restaurant).  You can buy any car you want.  You have personal assistants and are starting to have 'people' that others have to talk to to get to you.  You can travel ANYWHERE in any style.  You can buy pretty much anything that normal people think of as 'rich people stuff'</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>$100mm-$1billion</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I know its a wide range, but life doesn't change much when you go from being worth $200mm-$900mm.  At this point, you have a private jet, multiple residences with staff, elite cars at each residence, ownership or significant control over a business/entity that most of the public has heard of, if its your thing, you can socialize with movie stars/politicians/rock stars/corporate elite/aristocracy.  You might not get invite to every party, but you can go pretty much everywhere you want.  You definitely have 'people' and staff.  The world is full of 'yes men'.  Your ability to buy things becomes an art.  One of your vacation home may be a 5 bedroom villa on acreage in Cabo, but that's not impressive.  You own a private island?  Starting to be cool, but it depends on the island.  You just had dinner with Senator X and Governor Y at your home?  Cool.  But your billionaire friend just had dinner with the President.  You have a new Ferrari?  Your friend thinks their handling sucks and has a classic, only-five-exist-in-the-world-type of car.  Did I mention women?  Because at this level, they are all over the place.  Every event, most parties.  The polo club.  Ultra-hot, world class, smart women.  Power and money are an aphrodisiac and you have it in spades.  Anything thing you want from women at this point you will find a willing and beautiful partner.  You might not emotionally connect, but damn, she's hot.  One thing that gets rare at this level?  friends and family that love you for who you are.  They exist, but it is pretty damn hard to know which ones they are.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>$1billion</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>I am going to exclude the $10b+ crowd, because they live a head-of-state life.  But at $1b, life changes.  You can buy anything.  ANYTHING.  In broad terms, this is what you can buy:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Access.  You now can just ask your staff to contact anyone and you will get a call back.  I have seen this first hand and it is mind-blowing the level of access and respect $1 billion+ gets you.  In this case, I wanted to speak with a very well-known billionaire businessman (call him billionaire #1 for a project that interested billionaire #2.  I mentioned that it would be good to talk to billionaire #1 and B2 told me that he didn't know him.  But he called his assistant in.  \"Get me the xxxgolf club directory.  Call B1 at home and tell him I want to talk to him.\"  Within 60 minutes, we had a call back.  I was in B1's home talking to him the next day.  B2's opinion commanded that kind of respect from a peer.  Mind blowing.  The same is true with access to almost any Senator/Governor of a billionaires party (because in most cases, he is a significant donor).  You meet on an occassional basis with heads-of-state and have real conversations with them. Which leads to </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Influence.  Yes, you can buy influence.  As a billionaire, you have manyways to shape public policy and the public debate, and you use them.  This is not in any evil way.  the ones I know are passionate about ideas and are trying to do what they feel is best (just like you would).  But they just had an hour with the Governor privately, or with the Secretary of Health, or the buy ads or lobbyists.  The amount of influence you have can be heady.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Time.  Yes, you can buy time.  You literally never wait for anything.  Travel?  you fly private.  Show up at the airport, sit down in the plane and the door closes and you take off in 2 minutes, and fly directly to where you are going.  The plane waits for you.  If you decide you want to leave at anytime, you drive (or take a helicopter to the airport and you leave.  The pilots and stewardess are your employees.  They do what you tell them to do.  Dinner?  Your driver drops you off at the front door and waits a few blocks away for however long you need.  The best table is waiting for you.  The celebrity chef has prepared a meal for you (because you give him so much catering business he wants you VERY happy) and he ensures service is impeccable.  Golf?  Your club is so exclusive there is always a tee time and no wait.  Going to the Superbowl or Grammy's?  You are whisked behind velvet ropes and escorted past any/all lines to the best seats in the house.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Experiences.  Dream of it and you can have it.  Want to play tennis with Pete Sampras (not him in particular, but that type of star)?  Call his people. For a donation of $100k+ to his charity, you could probably play a match with him.  Like Blink182?  There is a price where they would simply come play at your private party.  Love art?  Your people could arrange for the curator of the Louvre to show you around and even show you masterpieces that have not been exhibited in years.  Love Nascar?  How about racing the top driver on a closed track?  Love science?  Have a dinner with Bill Nye and Neil dGT.  Love politics?  have Hillary Clinton come speak at a dinner for you and your friends, just pay her speaking fee.  Your mind is the only limit to what is available.  Because donations/fees get you anyone.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The same is true with stuff.  You like pianos?  How about owning one Mozart used to compose music on?  This is the type of stuff you can do.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>IMPACT.  Your money can literally change the world and change lives.  It is almost too much of a burden to think about.  Clean water for a whole village forever?  chump change.  A dying child need a transplant?  Hell...you could just build and fund a hospital and do it for a region.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>RESPECT.  The respect you get at this level is just over-the-top.  You are THE MAN in almost every circle.  Governors look up to you.  Fortune 500 CEOs look up to you.  Presidents and Kings look at you as a peer.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>PERSPECTIVE.  The wealthiest person I have spent time with makes about $400mm/year.  i couldn't get my mind around that until I did this:  OK--let's compare it with someone who makes $40,000/year.  It is 10,000x more.  Now let's look at prices the way he might.  A new Lambo--$235,000 becaome $23.50.  First class ticket internationally?  $10,000 becomes $1.  A full time executive level helper?  $8,000/month becomes $0.80/month.  A $10mm piece of art you love?  $1000.  Expensive, so you have to plan a bit.  A suite at the best hotel in NYC $10,000/night is $1/night.  A $50million home in the Hamptons? $5,000.  There is literally nothing you can't buy except.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Love.  Sorry to sound so trite, but it is nearly impossible to have a normal emotional relationship at this level.  It is hard to sacrifice for another person when you are never asked to sacrifice ANYTHING.  Money can solve all problems for someone, so you offer it, because there is so much else to do.  Your time is SOOOO  valuable that you ration it.  And that makes you lose connections with people.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Anyway, that is a really long answer, but I have a very unique perspective because I have seen behind the curtain of the great and mighty OZ.  just wanted to share</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>EDIT:  Wow!  An unbelievable response to this (8x gold and 6000 upvotes.  OMG)  Thank you for all the comments and PMs.  I am working 14 hour days right now, so I can't answer most, but to answer the most common PMs:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Seeing all of this doesn't make me want to get into the top tier.  Different lives have the same emotional degree of difficulty:  I met Sylvester Stallone at a party a few months back for the first time.  Great guy.  Has a beautiful, smart wife and a great career.  He had a special needs son who died young.  Nobody has it all.  Nobody.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2s9u0s/what_do_insanely_wealthy_people_buy_that_ordinary/cnnmca8/?context=3","type":"X"}},
