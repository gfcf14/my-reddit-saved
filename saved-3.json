The RNC would have moved to remove the Trump children from power, and a standard Republican candidate like Haley, Rubio or DeSantis would have emerged from the convention as the nominee. In fact my bet would be on a Haley-Rubio ticket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In response, the Dems would have completed their ‚Äòet tu Brute‚Äô coup against Biden, since the argument that he is the only one who could beat Trump would have dissolved. Kamala Harris would emerge as the candidate following a nasty backbiting Democratic Convention colored by accusations of racism and sexism. Her running mate is likely Shapiro to give the Dems Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In a very close election, Haley wins the Presidency after a hasty debate in which she clearly defeats Kamala, and America gets its first female President. Kamala would win Pennsylvania closely but lose every other Rust Belt state plus Florida and Nevada. The Trump influence fades back into the subtextual woodwork of right wing thought, as it has before after the likes of Faubus, McCarthy and Huey P. Long.</p>\n\n<p>All of which is enough to give conspiracy theorists on both sides plenty of ammo to fuel their crazy theories.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The reality is this was a symptom of America‚Äôs mass shooting culture, perpetrated by the exact same archetypal young isolated white male as every other mass shooting. He will certainly have used an AR that he likely was wearing the barrel out of at the range in recent weeks. His miss by less than two inches from 130 yards will be attributed to his nerves and his pulse rate in yanking the trigger in the heat of the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Motivations are likely to be scant, but there is a better than even chance he was a QAnon guy who got disturbed by Trump‚Äôs association with Epstein, spurred to act out of feelings of betrayal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1e3161d/what_do_you_think_realistically_would_have/ld4xxjm/?context=3","type":"X"}},

We could build our dream house, airbnb it, and it could potentially pay for the house within 10 years.</p>\n\n<p>The money to buy the land came from \"diversifying\" our assets, our financial portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>We would take on some risk to build this house, getting another mortgage. But theoretically, if everything works, we wouldn't have spent anything but would get a free dream house, and more. For what? For almost nothing.</p>\n\n<p>If we fucked up and lost our investment, burned the entire property down or what not, it'd still be fine. It wouldn't be life-ending. It'd be unfortunate but survivable.</p>\n\n<p>When I was growing up, my mom would make ramen for a special family meal, and she would use 3 ramen packets for our family of 4. She would add rice to the ramen broth after when we were still hungry.</p>\n\n<p>Once we used something, it would disappear. So we were frugal.</p>\n\n<p>A financial disaster meant starving, losing your home, etc. I spent my $10 for the week wrong? I can't afford lunch anymore and gotta starve for a week.</p>\n\n<p>I could have never imagined that once you get enough money, it just makes more money.</p>\n\n<p>Einstein said that compound interest is the world's eighth wonder.</p>\n\n<p>\"He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn't, pays it.\" </p>\n\n<p>You know when you're playing the Sims and in the beginning, you have to be careful about every dollar you spend? But after a certain point, when you're rich enough, it doesn't matter anymore, it's just numbers? That's what it's like for the most part. </p>\n\n<p>And you know how the game gets boring after you've bought everything in the game? </p>\n\n<p>The trick to getting rich life is that there will always be more expensive things that you can aspire to. Like I felt pretty good until I watched Owning Manhattan and was like hmm that Bad Bunny penthouse sure looks nice. </p>\n\n<p>But the key is to appreciate the things that money can't buy. Literally life, health, people, relationships, our planet, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Gratitude is a muscle, use it or lose it.</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dvwqzf/redditors_who_grew_in_poverty_and_are_now_rich/lbr9sj0/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Super easy to make and light years better than any store-bought ones. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre so good, we eat them all as snacks before we can add them to salads.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow! Did this blow up! Since people were asking, here‚Äôs my crouton recipe‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>I use whatever leftover bread we have in the house. We love sourdough, and we can get some pretty good stuff in nearby stores, so we usually use that.</p>\n\n<p>I cut it into thick slices.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in a bowl, I‚Äôll melt a stick of butter and add ¬Ω cup of extra virgin olive oil. To that mixture, I add a tablespoon each of garlic powder, onion powder and Italian herbs mix. Add an additional teaspoon of salt. Mix well.</p>\n\n<p>I then use a basting brush to generously brush the mixture on each side of the sliced bread. Then each slice gets cut lengthwise into about 4 or five strips, then crosswise into cubes. It can get a little messy, but it‚Äôs worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Line a large baking pan with parchment or foil and spread all the cubed bread evenly.</p>\n\n<p>Bake at 350¬∞ F for about 15 - 20 minutes, or until they‚Äôre golden brown/ lightly toasted-looking.</p>\n\n<p>Cool, then put in an airtight container.</p>\n\n<p>(You can adjust the seasonings to your taste: more garlic, salt, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: BTW, I save bread ends and scraps in my freezer until I have enough for a batch of croutons. I slice them up beforehand so they‚Äôre ready to be brushed and cubed when they come out of the freezer. It takes a while to thaw a hunk of bread in order to slice it properly.</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1dds2hv/cooks_of_reddit_whats_the_most_worth_it_thing_you/l871fvr/?context=3","type":"X"}},

I remember rationing my morphine because I could only take a certain number of doses every 24 hours and I knew I'd need some to sleep. I would be in agony all day but unable to take anything other than paracetamol because I needed the morphine before bed and through the night. Even then, the morphine itself didn't relieve the pain. It just made me sleepy enough to dose off for a few hours until the pain woke me again. I used hot water bottles constantly to try and make it less painful but it didn't help. I remember needing to use the toilet but waiting until I was desperate because it hurt so much to move. I remember not being able to make it downstairs some days because it just meant I'd have to come back up later. I remember the day my tumor caused a blood clot from pressing a blood vessel behind my knee, and I remember the day my tumor broke my femur when I shifted in bed. I remember the 20 hour wait in A&amp;E because there weren't any ambulances to take me to the city and I remember the 2 hour ambulance ride where they couldn't give me any medicine for the pain. I remember arriving at A&amp;E and being told that I might be rushed into surgery once I got to the city, meaning I was given no food or drink other than water. I remember arriving at the hospital and I remember being in an operating theatre getting a nerve blocker inserted in my femoral nerve for the pain. I remember breathing in some sort of gas that made my whole body feel numb and made me feel extremely drunk. Even my teeth felt numb and it was the only time in a long time that I wasn't in pain. I was just terrified of everything that was about to happen.</p>\n\n<p>And then there was the chemotherapy. Before it started I had to have tests to make sure I could handle the intensity of the drugs. One of these was a heart scan. They had to move me into a scanner and it was absolutle agony. My leg was so unstable that I had to stay in hospital for 3 months until they amputated it. I had to have 2 rounds of chemotherapy first. I lost so much weight because the nausea meant I couldn't keep anything down. I was sick, I had mouth ulcers, I developed tinnitus, I lost my curly hair, I had to have blood transfusions and pain medicine and blood thinner injections and injections to boost my neutrophils. Some days I had 11 pills to take at breakfast and then more throughout the day. I was bedridden and had to have help with nearly everything. It was horrific for a teenager. I had a PICC line inserted but it got infected and had to be taken out and replaced. This happened in a room with a surgical drape over me and an ultrasound machine used to find the vein. I had local anaesthetic for the procedure. I had antibiotics for a while and had to pause my chemo. I had three chemo drugs: doxorubicin, cisplatin and methotrexate. They were brutal, and every cycle of chemo lasted 5 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>When I had my amputation, I actually had an improvement in my quality of life. It was the first time I had had surgery other than the bone biopsy that confirmed my diagnosis, but that wasn't really a surgery. They only knocked me out for that because it would be painful. I could walk with crutches again, and I could go home and see my dogs. I had a hip disarticulation, meaning I lost my entire leg including my hip. I had a further 4 rounds of chemo and 36 weeks of immunotherapy afterwards. My methotrexate and cisplatin had to be stopped early because of liver damage and neuropathy respectively. I'll now have follow up appointments for 10 years to have chest xrays and make sure it stays away. This disease is utterly horrific, and I hope to god that it stays away. My life is just starting to get on track again, I'll be going to university this September and I'm getting a new prosthetic leg soon. I can drive and swim and cycle again. It all started with a sore knee but it was so much more that that. I'm just glad we found it when we did.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you all so much for the support and well-wishes! It means a lot to me. I'm just glad to be able to share my story and raise some awareness of this disease. Thank you again!</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1c9hr1c/human_skull_with_stage_1_bone_cancer/l0m0lb0/?context=3","type":"X"}},

The single-use aluminum beverage can.</p>\n\n<p>Since their release in 1957, aluminum cans have become the most engineered products in the world. The shape of the can allows the can be as light as possible and still be stacked and shipped. Securing the pull tab to the can was another engineering marvel where the failure point near the tab when you pull it allows the pressure inside the can to aid opening. Plus, since the pull tab is attached, the entire product could be recycled with no waste.</p>\n\n<p>The hole has been designed for maximum pourability. </p>\n\n<p>The shape of the can is the most efficient so when being shipped, the can takes up as little room as possible and still maintain its role in carrying liquid. The concave shape at the bottom of the can allows for less aluminum than would be needed with a flat bottom. The sidewall of a can is 75 microns. Once filled and sealed, the can can hold up to 80psi in pressure before the bottom starts to push out.</p>\n\n<p>More time has been spent engineering a can than any project you can name. The Space Shuttle, jumbo jets, the Manhattan Project all have less engineering time than the ongoing development of the aluminum can.</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1bjznjk/what_invention_has_peaked_been_perfected_to_the/kvuu6hr/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Thirteen is the only person to have visited him in jail until she physically couldn't anymore, despite of House yelling at her to not give up, to fight. House later learned she ended her own life, alone, with House failing to fulfill his promise to kill her, which has affected him greatly.</p></li>\n<li><p>House went into research, perhaps played some big role during the pandemic. He has not taken good care of himself and looks tired, has a gaunt face and now sports an unkempt beard. He lives on his own and his leg has gotten worse, he now has a shuffling gait. Vicodin eventually started causing issues even House couldn't ignore and he thus created a painkiller of his own, which is taking its toll on him. He sleeps for large parts of the day and talks to an imaginary Wilson.</p></li>\n<li><p>A former lover of House from during his time at Johns Hopkins contacts him. Her adult son is being treated by Dr. Chase's department of diagnostic medicine but they're clueless about what is wrong with him, with the medical world having seen only several similar cases before where all of the patients had died, likely through misdiagnosis and ineffective treatments. House reminds her that he is no longer a doctor and that Princeton-Plainsboro is the very last place he'd be welcome at. The woman reveals to House that her son might also be House's son.</p></li>\n<li><p>Foreman who has seemingly stayed in touch with House after reuniting over a drink to mourn Thirteen's death, brings House in on the case, albeit strictly as an advisor. They seem to be on good terms with one another, with House now calling him Eric. Foreman asks House <em>\"don't you think it's time to...?\"</em> but House cuts him off with a snide <em>\"No\"</em>. Foreman argues that <em>\"It might work!\"</em> to which House retorts with a second <em>\"No\"</em>. House is not received warmly by Chase, the latter having a whole new team with the exception of Park. The office looks modern, using a big digital screen instead of a whiteboard. House requests that several of his former fellows are brought back in, but only Taub returns and mostly out of a morbid curiosity to see how much House has changed. They reach several diagnoses, none of which are correct and House finds that Chase's team beats him to the punch every time, they're bright, experienced and up to date. House starts to question if he has lost his edge and if he is of any use to the team. He is positive that he has thought of everything possible and asks to be removed from the team. Foreman agrees to do so after 24 hours, quipping House may yet have a 'House moment'.</p></li>\n<li><p>At the insistence of the mother of his alleged son, he goes to talk with the young man. The two banter various topics as they find they share many mutual opinions on religion, politics and life. The son laments how he never got to know his father and that they should get a DNA test while they still can. House agrees, citing that the young man either has a whole lot of diseases or none of them and that they may not have much longer together. The son is thankful that House is honest about his chances, although he admits he's still hopeful that they can start anew if he ever gets cured. This triggers an epiphany for House, as he walks off mumbling the word <em>\"new\"</em> to himself.</p></li>\n<li><p>House grabs a marker and starts writing symptoms on the large digital screen, treating it as a whiteboard, much to the frustration of Chase. He starts attributing symptoms to the names of various conditions, eliminating any symptom that isn't mutually present in more than one condition and the team argues that one condition would still render any of the other conditions impossible. House scribbles something above the remaining symptoms and encircles all of the symptoms together. <em>\"House-disease\"</em> he says mirthfully. <em>\"I finally get to name something new\"</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The team races against the clock, desperately trying to treat the symptoms by eliminating treatments which had proven ineffective on previous patients. House, who previously felt useless in the team of young geniuses, has the most to contribute now. His years of experience in research after his release from prison allows him to come up with an experimental treatment. He spends nights adjusting the formula as it slowly starts to have an effect on the patient's condition. House goes to see the young man and they open up an envelope together. House is indeed his father.</p></li>\n<li><p>Alone at his home, House takes his painkillers, surprised at his pill bottle still being nearly full and realizes that him solving the puzzle and talking to his son had staved off the pain. House is about to take a pill while glaring at Wilson, telling him to <em>\"Don't look at me like that\"</em>. Before he can swallow his pills his son calls him. They talk curtly, like father like son but House excuses himself as he begins to rub his painful leg. House looks at the pills but puts them down. Imaginary Wilson smiles and says <em>\"Goodbye House\"</em>. House calls Foreman. He swallows hard and says over the phone: <em>\"It's time Eric, I want the amputation\"</em>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/HouseMD/comments/17vfdx1/what_would_a_house_continuation_in_2024_look_like/k9bcf78/?context=3","type":"X"}},

What do you do now?","content":"<h2>Someone asked me to repost my comment from another thread here, so here you go. Thanks <a href=\"/u/snatcharelli\">/u/snatcharelli</a></h2>\n\n<p>Congratulations! You just won millions of dollars in the lottery! That's great.</p>\n\n<p>Now you're fucked.</p>\n\n<p>No really.</p>\n\n<p>You are.</p>\n\n<p>You're fucked.</p>\n\n<p>If you just want to skip the biographical tales of woe of some of the math-tax protagonists, skip on down to the next comment, to see what to do in the event you win the lottery.</p>\n\n<p>You see, it's something of an open secret that winners of obnoxiously large jackpots tend to end up badly with alarming regularity. Not the $1 million dollar winners. But anyone in the nine-figure range is at high risk. Eight-figures? Pretty likely to be screwed. Seven-figures? Yep. Painful. Perhaps this is a consequence of the sample. The demographics of lottery players might be exactly the wrong people to win large sums of money. Or perhaps money is the root of all evil. Either way, you are going to have to be careful. Don't believe me? Consider this:</p>\n\n<p><em>Large jackpot winners face double digit multiples of probability versus the general population to be the victim of:</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Homicide (something like 20x more likely)</p></li>\n<li><p>Drug overdose</p></li>\n<li><p>Bankruptcy (how's that for irony?)</p></li>\n<li><p>Kidnapping</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>And triple digit multiples of probability versus the general population rate to be:</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Convicted of drunk driving</p></li>\n<li><p>The victim of Homicide (at the hands of a family member) 120x more likely in this case, ain't love grand?</p></li>\n<li><p>A defendant in a civil lawsuit</p></li>\n<li><p>A defendant in felony criminal proceedings</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Believe it or not, your biggest enemy if you suddenly become possessed of large sums of money is... you. At least you will have the consolation of meeting your fate by your own hand. But if you can't manage it on your own, don't worry. There are any number of willing participants ready to help you start your vicious downward spiral for you. Mind you, many of these will be \"friends,\" \"friendly neighbors,\" or \"family.\" Often, they won't even have evil intentions. But, as I'm sure you know, that makes little difference in the end. Most aren't evil. Most aren't malicious. Some are. None are good for you.</p>\n\n<p>Jack Whittaker, a Johnny Cash attired, West Virginia native, is the poster boy for the dangers of a lump sum award. In 2002 Mr. Whittaker (55 years old at the time) won what was, also at the time, the largest single award jackpot in U.S. history. $315 million. At the time, he planned to live as if nothing had changed, or so he said. He was remarkably modest and decent before the jackpot, and his ship sure came in, right? Wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Whittaker became the subject of a number of personal challenges, escalating into personal tragedies, complicated by a number of legal troubles.</p>\n\n<p>Whittaker wasn't a typical lottery winner either. His net worth at the time of his winnings was in excess of $15 million, owing to his ownership of a successful contracting firm in West Virginia. His claim to want to live \"as if nothing had changed\" actually seemed plausible. He should have been well equipped for wealth. He was already quite wealthy, after all. By all accounts he was somewhat modest, low profile, generous and good natured. He should have coasted off into the sunset. Yeah. Not exactly.</p>\n\n<p>Whittaker took the all-cash option, $170 million, instead of the annuity option, and took possession of $114 million in cash after $56 million in taxes. After that, things went south.</p>\n\n<p>Whittaker quickly became the subject of a number of financial stalkers, who would lurk at his regular breakfast hideout and accost him with suggestions for how to spend his money. They were unemployed. No, an interview tomorrow morning wasn't good enough. They needed cash NOW. Perhaps they had a sure-fire business plan. Their daughter had cancer. A niece needed dialysis. Needless to say, Whittaker stopped going to his breakfast haunt. Eventually, they began ringing his doorbell. Sometimes in the early morning. Before long he was paying off-duty deputies to protect his family. He was accused of being heartless. Cold. Stingy.</p>\n\n<p>Letters poured in. Children with cancer. Diabetes. MS. You name it. He hired three people to sort the mail. A detective to filter out the false claims and the con men (and women) was retained.</p>\n\n<p>Brenda, the clerk who had sold Whittaker the ticket, was a victim of collateral damage. Whittaker had written her a check for $44,000 and bought her house, but she was by no means a millionaire. Rumors that the state routinely paid the clerk who had sold the ticket 10% of the jackpot winnings hounded her. She was followed home from work. Threatened. Assaulted.</p>\n\n<p>Whittaker's car was twice broken into, by trusted acquaintances who watched him leave large amounts of cash in it. $500,000 and $200,000 were stolen in two separate instances. The thieves  spiked Whittaker's drink with prescription drugs in the first instance. The second incident was the handiwork of his granddaughter's friends, who had been probing the girl for details on Whittaker's cash for weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Even Whittaker's good-faith generosity was questioned. When he offered $10,000 to improve the city's water park so that it was more handicap accessible, locals complained that he spent more money at the strip club. (Amusingly this was true).</p>\n\n<p>Whittaker invested quite a bit in his own businesses, tripled the number of people his businesses employed (making him one of the larger employers in the area) and eventually had given away $14 million to charity through a foundation he set up for the purpose. This is, of course, what you are \"supposed\" to do. Set up a foundation. Be careful about your charity giving. It made no difference in the end.</p>\n\n<p>To top it all off, Whittaker had been accused of ruining a number of marriages. His money made other men look inferior, they said, wherever he went in the small West Virginia town he called home. Resentment grew quickly. And festered. Whittaker paid four settlements related to this sort of claim. Yes, you read that right. Four.</p>\n\n<p>His family and their immediate circle were quickly the victims of odds-defying numbers of overdoses, emergency room visits and even fatalities. His granddaughter, the eighteen year old \"Brandi\" (who Whittaker had been giving a $2100.00 per week allowance) was found dead after having been missing for several weeks. Her death was, apparently, from a drug overdose, but Whittaker suspected foul play. Her body had been wrapped in a tarp and hidden behind a rusted-out van. Her seventeen year old boyfriend had expired three months earlier in Whittaker's vacation house, also from an overdose. Some of his friends had robbed the house after his overdose, stepping over his body to make their escape and then returning for more before stepping over his body again to leave. His parents sued for wrongful death claiming that Whittaker's loose purse strings contributed to their son's death. Amazingly, juries are prone to award damages in cases such as these. Whittaker settled. Again.</p>\n\n<p>Even before the deaths, the local and state police had taken a special interest in Whittaker after his new-found fame. He was arrested for minor and less minor offenses many times after his winnings, despite having had a nearly spotless record before the award. Whittaker's high profile couldn't have helped him much in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>In 18 months Whittaker had been cited for over 250 violations ranging from broken tail lights on every one of his five new cars, to improper display of renewal stickers. A lawsuit charging various police organizations with harassment went nowhere and Whittaker was hit with court costs instead.</p>\n\n<p>Whittaker's wife filed for divorce, and in the process froze a number of his assets and the accounts of his operating companies. Caesars in Atlantic City sued him for $1.5 million to cover bounced checks, caused by the asset freeze.</p>\n\n<p>Today Whittaker is badly in debt, and bankruptcy looms large in his future.</p>\n\n<p>But, hey, that's just one example, right?</p>\n\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nearly one third of multi-million dollar jackpot winners eventually declare bankruptcy.

She told us this story from when she was in our high school.</p>\n\n<p>There was a well-known couple at the time; typical cheerleader and football star type deal. They were sort of off-and-on again, but it was obvious they did care about each other despite teenaged drama. </p>\n\n<p>Well, at point when they were ‚Äúoff‚Äù again, she went on a date with a new guy. He drugged and sexually assaulted her. She came home in tears to her older brother and told him what happened. Older brother said he‚Äôd handle it.</p>\n\n<p>He called the on-off boyfriend, who was also enraged. They both knew the guy who did it, so they pretended to invite him out to a bonfire. The boyfriend picked him up in his truck and drove him to the ‚Äúbonfire.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>The ‚Äúbonfire‚Äù was a stump in the middle of nowhere on a family member‚Äôs property. They chained the rapist to it and both took turns hitting his crotch with a sledgehammer. They untied him when they were done and left him there. </p>\n\n<p>He ended up at the ER later that night. The boyfriend and brother both knew the sheriff, because small town. So they called the sheriff to tell him exactly what they did and why. When he showed up to the hospital, the rapist tried to explain what happened, but the sheriff said, ‚ÄúSounds to me like a domestic issue.‚Äù and refused to charge the boyfriend or brother with anything because there was ‚Äúno proof‚Äù of what happened. </p>\n\n<p>Rapist got fixed up at the hospital (as much as they could) and left town shortly after graduation. Boyfriend and girlfriend get back together and didn‚Äôt break up again. They get married after college, have kids, happy ending. </p>\n\n<p>Small town justice is very, very real.</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14coqqm/whats_the_most_fucked_up_drama_from_somewhere/jomamfu/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Price per 1000L is 10$ instead of 1$/1L</p>\n\n<p>Heating-Cooling- Underfloor heating, as good as it comes. Heatpump for AC and water heating you getting from 3KW consumption the power of 18-20KW heater/cooler. Energy Recovery System- instead of have to reheat or cool 100% of the space, you just need to do it  for 70% worst case. You can even cool the water before use with a heatpump and you get instant 2 degrees water in summer heat.Even whole house humidity control, it prolongs everything.</p>\n\n<p>Insulation-If you get the entire house insulated with Aerogel you are done, nothing else it is 80$/m2 just the material.</p>\n\n<p>Electrical panel- It comes with fuses,relays,contactor, AFDD-RCBO/AFCI/GFCI(do not remember the american designation). When something happens with the electrical grid, nothing burns in the house due to overvoltage or lightning strike, just replace the component in the panels and off to the races.</p>\n\n<p>Better internet-There are places where it is more economical to pay for better internet, than for the electricity to wait for download or upload.</p>\n\n<p>Electric Car- Price/distance is already shamefully lower, just wait for solid/permanent batteries.</p>\n\n<p>Photovoltaic panels and battery, you can make it thru the night up to the 50 degree latitude.</p>\n\n<p>3 glazed windows modern installation techniques and afterwords some silicone spray and  a pressure test, no more energy loss to the outside and re heating/cooling. Also complete silence even during a gun-fight(at 50m distance minimum)</p>\n\n<p>With Energy recovery Ventilation- you always get fresh filtered outside air without any pollutants =&gt; less health problems(yes medical visits are utilities, you do them regularly enough)</p>\n\n<p>Electronics- A very nice Fridge-uses 100KWH/year a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù one uses 500 KWH/year, any saving are lost in the first year and the same for dryer and washing machines and anything else in the house.</p>\n\n<p>LED- self explanatory</p>\n\n<p>People that can plan all this will make it even better than on your own.</p>\n\n<p>Home automation-this drops consumption by 15%/year.</p>\n\n<p>Edit1: I can keep going</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yspp3n/what_is_an_unofficial_tax_on_the_poor/iw0etmh/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Your reward system gets dependent on pornographic stimulation, much like a drug. You need higher amounts of dopamine to achieve the same ‚Äòhigh‚Äô, so you resort to dirtier and more perverse stimulation with each session. At some point, it feels like nothing is enough. Then when you go to have a real relationship, you feel no natural affection or butterflies or real intimacy. Your brain is burned out from watching perversity and you experience erectile dysfunction.</p>\n\n<p>Emotionally/spiritually? You are watching other humans engage in perverse acts and arousing yourself to it. When you do this, you erode your conscience and your self-respect and confidence plummets. You lust after people rather than find them attractive. You find it difficult to maintain eye contact or hold a conversation with an attractive stranger without having lustful thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>And more!</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wwdre1/what_are_the_disadvantages_of_watching_porn/ilkj1tt/?context=3","type":"X"}},

He hadn't eaten for 2 weeks, wasn't moving, lost loads of weight, looked awful, and was clearly in pain. He had spent a month getting specialist treatment.  The vet knew we had a young daughter and said we should take him home and give our daughter a chance to say goodbye and bring him back to be euthanized.</p>\n\n<p>Fucker got home, ate all our other cats food, ripped a feeding tube out of his own throat, spent the night headbutting the locked cat flap, and miaowed all over us all night while we cried our eyes out.  We took him back the next day and the vet said 'well I've never seen a cat recover like this from this bad damage but i can't put him down if he's eating again. See what happens and keep me updated'.  Lived another 2 years cos the vet was a decent compassionate man. Kidney problems ended up killing him peacefully in his sleep but we had 2 more glorious years with him. </p>\n\n<p>RIP Stanny my beautiful, beautiful cat.
