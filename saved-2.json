A watch? I wander over, greet him, and ask what he'd like to start off with to drink. \"Ummm, I dunno, I'm meeting someone, is it rude to have a drink already before they get here?\" I smiled, asked if he was waiting for a date, he said yes, and I suggested a beer to sip on instead of a mixed drink; it might calm his nerves a bit, but won't get him inebriated too quickly so he could enjoy his date. He agreed, apologized profusely for bothering me (which, he hadn't bothered me at all) , and continued to wait. </p>\n\n<p>After about 20 mins of him waiting (and him checking his watch every 5), I wandered over again and asked if he'd like to look at a food menu, perhaps munch on something while he waited. He declined, and glanced at his watch again. I made a comment about his watch and how I appreciated his use of \"analog technology\", and he laughed nervously and said he didn't want to pull out or use his phone during his date, because he didn't want to seem disingenuous (how <em>cute</em>!) </p>\n\n<p>Another 30 minutes pass, and my high-strung hopeful was still alone. I asked if he'd changed his mind about some food, and he merely shook his head, defeated...\"I'll just finish my beer and go...I'm sorry I wasted one of your tables...\"</p>\n\n<p>On his last swig of beer, a cute looking girl walked in, eyeing the room, obviously looking for someone. \"Chelsea! Over here!\", he started to stand, grin from ear to ear...the entrance was near my drink well, which I had just happened to be standing in. This night was particularly quiet, and the acoustics allow me to her chitter chatter in the entryway (curved ceilings)...I look over to the girl after seeing my hopeful's eyes light up, and she had a disgusted look of, \"dammit\" in her face, she rolled her eyes and made contact with mine, sighed, and said, \"are you fucking kidding me with this guy?\", screwed on her fake smile, and immediately sat down, avoiding a half-hug attempt by my hopeful.</p>\n\n<p>The entire date felt forced; every time I went to check on them, she was ordering another drink, and he was doing his best to try and pull conversation from this girl, who had her face in her phone the entire time. </p>\n\n<p>About an hour later, I watch the girl get up with her purse, announce that she had to use the restroom, and wandered away towards the restrooms. I immediately went over to my hopeful to ask how his date was going. \"I don't think she likes me...\", he trailed off. I gave him a pat on the shoulder, and said it looked to me like he was doing everything right. He smiled, thanked me, and I went back to my bar.</p>\n\n<p>The girl never came back. He footed her tab. $90 worth of drinks, his two beers were $8.</p>\n\n<p>He continued to come back as a regular, and I became his wing-woman. I eventually set up Mr Hopeful with Ms Lonely-heart. They're still together.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: spelling</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I was not anticipating such an interest in Mr Hopeful and Ms Lonely-Heart, but I will gladly tell what I know of their story! I'm at work currently, and I'd like to give the same amount of effort to put into their story, as I did initially, so I will definitely post when I get home a little later! Thank you all for the awards!</p>\n\n<p>Edit 3: Ms Lonely-Heart's story is in its own comment below, along with how she and Mr Hopeful met. You all are lovely, I'm so happy I could share with you!</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/llsy4i/waiterswaitresses_of_reddit_whats_the_most/gnry5ux/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Had a normal software job, and was too exhausted at the end of the day to want to do more dev on personal projects. Here's what I did.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Worked on table top games in my free time. Scratched the game design itch without sitting on the computer staring at code</li>\n<li>Game Jams. Much easier to get motivated for one big weekend than a regular project. Especially on site ones. I always tried going into each with a goal. Learn Unity. One level with a boss you can defeat. Interactive narrative with an ending and multiple ways to get there. Finish something with art and audio.</li>\n<li>GDC. My dev job paid reasonably well, so I took a week vacation every year to attend. Was able to meet and chat with folks there from the place I work now before I even applied with them. It also helped build up a knowledge base, even if I wasn't applying it on my day job.</li>\n<li>Started saving early. This didn't help break in, but traditional software pays better than games. Expect to take a pay cut. I'm making 25% less now, but I have a lifestyle that can afford that, and a good start on my savings from before.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ultimately I got lucky too. My home town doesn't have a large game dev presence, until recently just a few small indie studios. When a mid sized studio moved here there was not a lot of other local talent I was competing with for my position. This was fortunate both because it meant that I didn't need to move, and also the specific role tends not to have entry level positions, so if I did start elsewhere I'd have to work my way up.</p>\n\n<p>From everything I read, everybody has a different path for how they get in. You'll have to find what works best for you.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/lle9aj/how_do_you_get_into_the_game_dev_industry/gnp6wvm/?context=3","type":"X"}},

My family didn‚Äôt have too much growing up and I had JUST transferred out of a public school and got a partial scholarship to go to a private middle school/high school. My parents thought lunch prices were going to be the same so I received $5 a week for food. We didn‚Äôt have money so I never wanted to tell my parents that $5 a week wasn‚Äôt enough so I just waited until the end of the school day so that I could walk to McDonald‚Äôs for a $1 mcchicken or McDouble because school lunches were $5 minimum for a mini plate.</p>\n\n<p>I had 2 friends help me throughout my rough financial time in high school. They saw that I would never eat at school and basically fed me without pitying me. One friend would order more than he could eat and would always ask me if I could do him the favor of finishing his food so it doesn‚Äôt go to waste. The other friend would do things like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôll bet you lunch you can‚Äôt do this‚Äù and it‚Äôd be something simple like ‚Äúyou have 3 shots to shoot this paper ball into the trash can‚Äù or ‚Äúrace to drink this water bottle first‚Äù or even just ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy you lunch if you walk to the cafeteria with me‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>I didn‚Äôt really realize too much when I was younger and I thought they were just rich and were careless with their money. It turns out, they took notice to the fact that I didn‚Äôt eat at school. They told me in college that they always saw me with nothing at lunch and when we hung out after school, I would only buy the one Mcchicken/McDouble and I would still be asking friends for the 10cents I needed for tax. These were the first friends I‚Äôve made before I even knew the true value of money and they‚Äôre still two of my best friends to this day.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: This is how everyone should treat their friends.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/XTqIuTC\">https://imgur.com/a/XTqIuTC</a></p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hl3tni/when_you_were_a_kid_what_was_a_sign_that_a_kid/fwydl95/?context=3","type":"X"}},

The tours are expensive and the inside is kind of underwhelming. The outside is free and is also the best part. ALTERNATIVE: Just walk around Sydney harbor. It's free and gorgeous.</p></li>\n<li><p>Duomo of Florence. The outside is magnificent, the interior is bland and underwhelming and not worth the line up. If you've seen the outside, that's all you need to see. It doesn't even make sense to go up the duomo to the viewpoint because you get a much better view of Florence from the viewpoint across the river. ALTERNATIVE: Piazzale Michelangelo</p></li>\n<li><p>Eiffel Tower. Cool up close. Don't go up though. ALTERNATIVE: Go up Tour Montparnasse instead as it's cheaper, has a much shorter line up and you can actually see the Eiffel Tower. </p></li>\n<li><p>Statue of Liberty. Why even bother? Take a cheap boat cruise around Manhattan and they'll take you up close to it for a good view. No point in lining up to go in. ALTERNATIVE: Hudson River cruise</p></li>\n<li><p>Ruins of Troy. Totally disappointing. Troy is basically just a bunch of heavily eroded rocks. ALTERNATIVE: Ephesus is absolutely jaw dropping</p></li>\n<li><p>Hollywood Walk of Fame. Dirty, tacky and boring. Skip it. ALTERNATIVE: Griffith Observatory</p></li>\n<li><p>Times Square. Get your photo and leave. It's awful. Aggressive mascots trying to rip you off, overpriced and gross restaurants and just not enjoyable at all. ALTERNATIVE: Anywhere else in Manhattan. Try the High Line. </p></li>\n<li><p>Casablanca, Morocco. The entire city is a dump and is not the romantic, elegant place people think it is. The only part worth seeing is the Hassan II Mosque, which is really nice. Everything else can be skipped. It's also seedy as hell. ALTERNATIVE: Marrakech, Chefchaouen, Fes... basically any other city in Morocco is better.</p></li>\n<li><p>Anne Frank House. Not worth the lineup, IMO. ALTERNATIVE: Rijksmuseum</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT (Some more):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Osaka Castle: Literally just a modern shopping mall inside. It's a reconstruction, and not a great one. Very disappointing. ALTERNATIVE: Himeji Castle is actually authentic.</p></li>\n<li><p>Macau: Unless you're going to gamble it's basically just Chinese Vegas. And it's ugly and dirty, which is surprising considering how wealthy it is. ALTERNATIVE: Hong Kong is superior in almost every way.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cinque Terre. Maybe this one is controversial but I found it very boring and overly touristy. And all the hiking trails were closed. Not sure if they're open now. Either way, it's a day trip at best. ALTERNATIVE: Amalfi Coast</p></li>\n<li><p>Navy Pier: Unless you want to eat McDonalds in a dirty food court, I'm not sure what the draw of this place is. ALTERNATIVE: Literally anywhere else in the Loop.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cartagena historical center: The town center is very pretty, unfortunately it's completely ruined by annoying and incessant beggars, merchants, con artists, street children and overtourism. You can't walk 2 ft without being mobbed by people, and don't even think about sitting outside at a restaurant unless you want to be interrupted every 5 minutes by people trying to rap at you. ALTERNATIVE: Guatape, Salento</p></li>\n<li><p>Waikiki. Why? Just why? Literally the worst beach in a place with some of the greatest natural beauty on Earth. Why would you want to stay on a shitty strip of beach in a concrete jungle surrounded by a Cheesecake Factory and homeless people? ALTERNATIVE: Maui, Kauai, Big Island... anywhere but there.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d54053/what_popular_tourist_attraction_is_totally_not/f0jstqc/?context=3","type":"X"}},

You can move this shape to another \"1\" to change/add chords, thus creating a progression. Also try two tone \"chords\" of 1-5 (aka as the power chord on guitar). Once you get the hang of this you can add melodic notes with your right hand. Depending on where you start, this method can create major, minor, and diminished chords. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: One other tip is to work the same notes in sequence like a scale rather than just always mashed in unison as a chord: 1&gt;3&gt;5. Then try mixing chords and note runs. It's also worth noting that this harmonious sequence can continue: 1-3-5-7-9...You won't be able to play that as a chord with one hand, but it can be a framework of what notes to incorporate, jump to, &amp; experiment with because there isn't a bad note as long as you just keep playing every other white key.</p>\n\n\t\t","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/c5g2sp/what_can_you_teach_the_rest_of_us_here_within_one/es1soqu/?context=3","type":"X"}},

I went to a pet store to buy food for my lovebird. This little grey parrot saw me, let out an enthusiastic cry and flew over. She landed on my chest, gripping onto my shirt with her nails. I started to pet her and she made ecstatic noises, rubbing her head into the pet as hard as she could. After 15 minutes I needed to go but she refused to let go. I tried to get her off for 10 minutes and could not. The staff could not get her off either. The staff said, 'I think you broke our bird, you have to buy her now'.  I agreed. She was four months old when I brought her home. Within a month she stared deeply in my eyes and said 'I love you'. It was the first thing she said apart from her name that they gave her at the pet store. She tells me 'I love you' at least once a day. She likes to sit on my shoulder and press her beak into my ear and whisper it to me. She knows hundreds of words and speaks in short sentences, so she understands and chooses what she says. I've gotten an  'I love you' every day now for almost 18 years.</p>\n      \n      <p>Edit: For everyone asking this is Lilly.

There's billions of women out there in various cultural environments - I just listed what would seem okay for ME, PERSONALLY in the environment that I'm used to. There's no master guide, fellas.

I mean, put aside the romantic aspect - a new neighbor moves into your apartment building and you what...ignore them for the rest of eternity? I don't know where you're from or what's your situation, but where I live you can only run into the same person that many times in your environment before it starts feeling rude <em>not</em> to at least give them a little 'hello' nod or not get one from them.</p></li>\n      </ol>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/97hlr5/women_of_reddit_how_can_a_man_with_whom_you/e48cg2b/","type":"X"}},

You're swimming in money, everything is great, you start paying off your student loans and finally live by yourself (maybe).</p>\n      \n      <p>After a few years and maybe a promotion, you switch jobs and you're now making $50k. If you were swimming in money before, now you're just drowning in it. You upgrade your car, upgrade your apartment or even buy an expensive house, start shelling out hundreds of dollars on this and that, get an expensive hobby, and somehow even though you're making a ton more money, you save less than when you were making $30k.</p>\n      \n      <p>To fix, don't improve your lifestyle when you get a raise or get more money in your new job. There are some things you should upgrade and primarily they are:</p>\n      \n      <ul>\n      <li>your shoes</li>\n      <li>your bed</li>\n      <li>your car (i.e. upgrading from a beater to a more stable car)</li>\n      <li>work clothes (i.e. torn/ripped vs. more professional ones)</li>\n      <li>food (i.e. junk food vs. healthy food)</li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <p>If you're set already and if you get a 5% raise, increase your retirement account contributions until you're maxed out on 401k and Roth IRA. That's a solid $24k of your salary right there so it'll take a while to fill up.</p>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8d4uwr/what_are_lifes_rookie_mistakes/dxke8kc/?context=3","type":"X"}},

You never expressed any kind of disdain or machismo when I asked for your help untangling my Barbie's hair or prodding you with magic fairy wands. </p></li>\n      <li><p>You never hesitated to teach me practical skills - and you never attributed gender to them. It was always, \"Come over here and let me show you how to snake the drain, because you're going to need to do this.\" BTW dad, I snaked my first drain all on my own last month! I'm so glad you taught me.</p></li>\n      <li><p>Thank you for bailing me out when I was in a pinch, no questions asked. No guilting, no attempts at squeezing out information. I felt like I could come to you with any dilemma. This took a load of my shoulders because Mom is so reactive and \"freak out first, maybe resolve later.\" </p></li>\n      <li><p>You respect me, which makes me respect you even more. When I call you out on BS, you actually repent and reflect. You don't deflect back on me and pull the, \"I'm the parent and know better than you\" spiel. </p></li>\n      <li><p>You actually took the time to sit and watch my cartoons or (attempt) to understand my video games or other hobbies. Mom always turned up her nose. You didn't. Do you know how awesome it is to watch your Dad actually laugh at the cartoon your mother just dismissed as \"dumb\" minutes before? So gratifying.</p></li>\n      <li><p>All those times you went shopping for groceries and picked up ladies sanitary supplies without any hesitation, even if you did affectionately rename the long super maxi pads, \"low-salt maxis.\"</p></li>\n      <li><p>Thank you for all those secret times you let me pick something out of the vending machine to eat when we were on trips together - you knew Mom would never allow it.</p></li>\n      <li><p>You take great pride in \"embarrassing me\" - but you know exactly where to draw the line so it's endearingly goofy, not genuinely embarrassing. You know your audience and play to it. I feel no shame when my friends (or now-fiance) are around you.</p></li>\n      <li><p>It's okay if your hands were too callused to properly tie my ballet skirt before classes. I could tie it myself. But I didn't tell you at the time because I knew it made you happy to help me. So don't be embarrassed because the fabric kept snagging on your calluses.</p></li>\n      <li><p>I wish you took your dental hygiene more seriously. I think your lax attitude and seeing you lose a lot of your teeth didn't set the best example for my sister while we were growing up.</p></li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <p><strong>EDIT - did not expect Gold, yikes!</strong> I realize closing with a comment about my Dad's flossing habits is kind of lame but it was stream of consciousness. I'm getting married in the fall and have been planning on writing a letter to my parents separately, so many of the points I made here I already want to share with him. He's my hero!</p>\n      \n      <p><strong>EDIT EDIT</strong> Just in case people are worried, I adore my mom and we're really close. This probably makes her sound like a buzzkill, but I swear I could absolutely spend all day writing how incredible she is too. </p>\n      \n      <p>Also, I called my dad and the first thing he says when he picks up is, \"Oh good! I was hoping you'd call, I picked a song for our father-daughter dance at your wedding.\" I was sure to tell him how I felt.</p>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/84e0nc/daughters_of_reddit_what_is_something_you_wish/dvou0jj/?context=3","type":"X"}},

In that time, he had fought many battles. He‚Äôd warred against wizards of the 9th Pentagram. He‚Äôd dueled against the Necromancer Gix and his army of Shadowspawn. He‚Äôd even participated in the Battle of the Twelve, one of the few dragons to stand against the Great Shadow. Finally he‚Äôd retired with his gold and his books to live near the sleepy village of Hillsdale, to live out his remaining hundred years in solitude and scholarly pursuit. </p>\n      \n      <p>And yet, none of those battles, none of those trials, none of those tribulations had prepared him for the greatest challenge he would ever face.</p>\n      \n      <p>An unruly human teenager.</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I go?‚Äù Tythel asked, her smooth tan face furrowing into a frown.</p>\n      \n      <p>Karjon sighed heavily, a sound that filled the entire cave that was his lair and their home. ‚ÄúWhen, exactly, did ‚Äòbecause I said so‚Äô become insufficient?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúWhen I turned sixteen. Karjon, you <em>promised.</em>‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúI said that you could go into the village when you were sixteen, Tythel. I did not say you could do so the very next day.‚Äù Making that promise, back when she was nine, had been a mistake. He‚Äôd done it to get her to cease her incessant questions. He didn‚Äôt think humans of that age could <em>remember</em> things for so long.</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre splitting scales and you know it,‚Äù she folded her arms across her chest and glowered at him.</p>\n      \n      <p>Karjon, who weighed in just over six tons and had battled some of the greatest foes the world had ever seen, found he was unable to match his adopted daughter‚Äôs glare. He‚Äôd never had children of his own, and whelps were very different from humans. ‚ÄúTythel, there are reasons for the choices I make. They are for your safety.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúYou always hide behind that, Karjon. Are you planning on keeping me here the rest of my life? What are you hiding me <em>from?</em>‚Äù </p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúThere are those out there that would see you dead. Is that not enough explanation?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>She again glowered at him. ‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt do anything if you don‚Äôt tell me. But if you want me to leave it alone, you‚Äôll need to give me more than that.‚Äù Her expression softened. ‚ÄúPlease, father.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>Karjon sighed again. ‚ÄúI will tell you how you came here, and that will tell you why you must not leave. If I do so, will you let the matter go?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúOf course, thank you!‚Äù she said, running forward and giving his foreleg a hug. He reached over with a scaled claw and gently patted her back. </p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúDo not thank me yet. We‚Äôll have to see what you think after I have told you. It started, as you might have suspected, sixteen years ago‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <hr>\n      \n      <p>Sixteen years had not changed Karjon much, although back then he had valued his privacy even more. Lathariel, Queen of the Woods, was the first visitor he‚Äôd had in over fifty years. Technically she was not a queen, but a lesser goddess, but she‚Äôd preferred that title over to the others she‚Äôd worn over the centuries. ‚ÄúKarjon, please. The world needs you. This threat-‚Äú</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúThis threat,‚Äù he responded gruffly, ‚Äúis just another threat, Lathariel. There will always be another threat.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúNo, Karjon, this is different. They came from beyond the clouds, beyond the stars! They‚Äôre unnatural-‚Äú</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúGix was unnatural, and he was defeated.‚Äù Karjon heaved himself around to directly focus on the horned woman. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Lathariel. I‚Äôm tired and old, and will not live much longer, even by how my people reckon things. Find some prophesy that tells you who can defeat this threat, or gather a new Council of Twelve. But leave me be. Let me have my twilight years in peace.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúWould you rather those years cut short, when Those From Above come to your cave?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúIf they come to my cave, I will destroy them. But they will not, Lathariel. I am safe here.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúKarjon‚Ä¶the only thing we have found that works against their Sky Ships is dragonfire. Without you, we-‚Äú</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúHave the younger drakes, whose fire burns hotter than me. Enough, Lathariel. I will not be swayed.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúNo, Karjon, I see you will not. Then enjoy your hole, <em>old friend,</em>‚Äù she‚Äôd put more venom into those last two words than existed in all the insects in her forest, ‚Äúif I survive, perhaps I‚Äôll visit again. Then again, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd care either way.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>And with that, she was gone.</p>\n      \n      <hr>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you help them, though? What are Those From Above?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>Karjon huffed. ‚ÄúI did not help them for that reason. I was too old, too tired. I am older and more tired now. And before you ask that next question,‚Äù he snapped as he saw her mouth open, ‚Äúyes, Those from Above were victorious.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúWhat happened to the people, then?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúThey are still out there, but Those From Above rule them now. And that ties into why you cannot go out‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <hr>\n      \n      <p>It was weeks later when he heard footsteps in the entrance to his passage. ‚ÄúLathariel, I told you that you should not‚Ä¶return?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>The figure standing there was not Lathariel, but a human. One wearing the golden armor of the Royal Guard. ‚ÄúOh Light and Shadow, a dragon lives in this cave,‚Äù the knight said weakly, clutching a bundle to his chest. ‚ÄúPlease, great beast, I mean no harm. I am too weak to fight. If you must slay me, spare my charge.‚Äù Karjon sniffed the air and could smell blood under the armor, lots of it ‚Äì this human would not live much longer.</p>\n      \n      <p>The knight‚Äôs charge chose that exact moment to start crying. It was an infant, a human infant, and it was hungry. </p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúI will spare you and your charge. But why have you brought-‚Äú</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúShe is the princess, and the last of her line. I sought to hide her, but‚Ä¶‚Äù he shrugged slightly. ‚ÄúI fear I do not have much longer.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <hr>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúHold on, I‚Äôm a <em>princess?</em> Tythel asked, unable to contain herself. </p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúNot just a princess, Tythel. The Princess. Last heir to the house of Armtine. Rightful ruler of these lands. And that, my daughter, is why you cannot leave this cave. Those From Above would fear you would start a rebellion, that you would rally resistance against them. They would kill you for what you are.‚Äù Karjon turned to look at her, locking his repitllian gaze with hers. ‚ÄúDo you understand now?‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>She nodded after a moment, and her voice came out small and quiet. ‚ÄúYes, father.‚Äù</p>\n      \n      <p>‚ÄúGood. Now rest. You are old enough where you can survive the Ritual. Tomorrow, you will become my half-daughter in blood as well as in spirit ‚Äì but you will need your strength.‚Äù Karjon beamed at her, hoping the good news would alleviate her despondent frown.</p>\n      \n      <p>It did some, and Karjon was well pleased. Which showed how little Karjon knew about humans, even after raising one for sixteen years. </p>\n      \n      <p>He had no idea she was already planning to leave after the Ritual.</p>\n      \n      <hr>\n      \n      <p>More at <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Hydrael_writes\">/r/Hydrael_writes</a></p>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/813gcd/wp_youre_a_powerful_dragon_that_lived_next_to_a/dv0afu7/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour.

If it's not injured, and it's not in danger (middle of the street, near a predator) - leave it alone. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most likely its nest and parents are nearby. Don't put it back in its nest. It probably hopped out of its nest. It doesn't want to be in its nest. It wants to stay out and play video games with its friends until morning so just leave it alone. The nest is lame. It smells. It's loud. Don't put it back in its nest.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>When birds reach a certain age they hop out of the nest and try to take shelter on the ground while they wait for the rest of their feathers to come in. They can't really fly and they're storing energy, so they'll look like little fucking stupid free samples from Costco. But at this point their nest may be more dangerous and attract predators, so their instinct is to hide on the ground for a couple of days until they can fly.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you take it inside or move it too far away, its parents won't be able to feed it and it'll (probably) die. You may also fuck up and do more harm than good because like any awkward teenager they're fragile little things and are easily stressed. If it's in the street or you see a cat prowling nearby, you can try to move it under some bushes close to where you found it so its parents won't lose track of it.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It's probably not moving because it's tired. It's probably chirping because it's letting its parents know it wants food. They're probably not feeding it because you're nearby wringing your hands. Leave it alone and it'll most likely be fine, unless God hates that particular bird.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>If it looks like a fleshy, patchy <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4hGkhgq.jpg\">Freddy Krueger wannabe</a>,</strong> it was probably knocked out of its nest before it was ready. While the fluffy ones are like teenagers, these fleshy ones are more like children. See if you can find the nest and put it back in the nest (carefully). As other users have since mentioned, it's also possible the parents forced the baby out of the nest because it was weak or sick and they didn't want it to take resources away from the babies which had a better chance at surviving, so even putting it back in the nest is a toss-up. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you can't find the nest, you can put it in a small box lined with tissue or grass and hang it from a tree. The parents may be nearby, but they won't approach until you're gone for an hour or more.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>If the bird looks injured or abandoned</strong>, you can try taking it to a local Wildlife Care Center. Make sure it's actually a baby and not a fledgling because your local Wildlife Center probably gets a lot of birds each Spring from concerned humans who can't stand to leave \"babies\" sitting on the ground and now that Center is responsible for raising a bird which really just wanted to chill near its parents. If you're not sure if it's injured, leave it alone. A bird sitting on its own doing nothing isn't necessarily injured - it's probably just resting.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you try to take care of it yourself, it'll probably die. You can look up how to feed and care for baby birds, but it still might die. You can raise it for weeks and when you let it go, it still might die. If you take it to a local Wildlife Center, it still might die.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unfortunately, that's life. Fortunately, there are a lot of birds.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6sshd4/what_common_knowledge_is_simply_not_true/dlf9r1x/?context=3","type":"X"}},

It's a comment I made awhile back. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Say what you want, man, Krillin is the most badass character on that show in my opinion.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>For starters, dude knocks out three Saibamen with one attack, when fucking Yamcha can't even take out one. That being said, it more highlights how shitty Yamcha is rather than Krillin's power. But we'll get there.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Even Vegeta freaked out about the Destructo Disk. Nappa was gonna try to block it/take the attack, and Vegeta literally flipped shit and told him to get out of the way. The disc cut his cheek, and that was only because he dodged it at the last second. He drew blood when no one, not even Piccolo could. Nappa was at least ten times stronger than Krillin.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Now let's move to the Frieza saga. This guy is at the literal bottom of the totem pole, save for Bulma. Even little seven year old or whatever Gohan could kick his ass. Think about that, getting your ass handed to you on a silver platter by a first grader. Shit's crazy, yo, and it's no wonder that he had trouble fighting considering those massive balls he had to carry around everywhere. But guess what, Krillin fucking fought everyone anyways, and for what? He ends up dying at the hands of the strongest creature in the universe at that time, from a cheap shot no less. That cheap shot was a retaliation because this fun sized Vin Diesel look alike chopped off Frieza's tail! Not even Piccolo fused with Nail could do that much damage, but this fucking human could. Crazy shit. I'm not finished yet, though.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Here's the fucking cream of the crop. In the Cell saga, Cell creates \"Cell Jrs.\", which literally force Trunks, Goku and Vegeta into Super Saiyan form (the form which introduced Frieza to an astounding weight loss program on Namek). This motherfucker holds off one on his own. The other three were fighting one each as well. Krillin, this little short, bald looking human motherfucker with wrecking balls between his legs is fighting something that Saiyans have to go into Super Saiyan to fight.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You tell me that Krillin isn't the strongest motherfucking human in that show. It's no fucking wonder that Android 18 wanted to be with him. I'm surprised she didn't fucking short circuit from all the moisture coming from her crotch.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6938xq/what_fan_theory_do_you_100_accept_as_true/dh3e2k3/?context=3","type":"X"}},

Or, what is the worst thing you have seen a student do to a teacher?","content":"<div class=\"md\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>The Lazy Bum</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>As a teacher, you have a lot of students who have learning disabilities.  Anywhere from 10% to 40% of my classes had some sort of special accommodation.  There's a document for each kid in the special ed system.  It's called different things depending on where you teach, but for our purposes I'll call it a 'Specialized Education Plan'.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Basically it details whether a given student gets to take extra time on a test, or extra time to turn in assignments, or need to have exam questions read to him/her, or needs shorter assignments, etc.   There are about 40 different ways we can accommodate kids with special needs, and each kid has a plan.  So I might have 6 class periods x 5 kids per class = 30 different plans.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I was one of the more involved educators at that school with regard to the specialized education plans (SEPs).   The special ed staff knew me well because I was frequently down on that end of campus, discussing with them how various students learn best, how I could best deal with certain disabilities and meet certain needs, et cetera.  I had a good reputation in the special ed department as being one of the teachers who cared.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I had a kid in my class who was failing.  Hard.  Primarily due to failure to submit work.  He (we'll call him Dave) had a specialized education plan, and I accommodated where I could, but it's tough to grant accommodations when Dave won't do any work at all.   (Sure, I can give him a shorter assignment - but he's not doing it.)</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So I had been in touch with his Mom off and on via e-mail.  It was standard practice for me to contact parents via e-mail and stay in touch.  She was upset her son was failing.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>One of the special education instructors took me aside in order to 'do me a favor' and give me some counsel. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Her:  \"Mr. Deradius, I hear Dave is failing your class.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me: \"Yes, Mrs. Jones, Dave is failing my class.\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Her:  \"Why?\" </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me: \"Ms. Jones, Dave is lazy and won't submit any assignments.\"  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Her:  \"Have you been providing Dave with appropriate accommodations?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me:  \"Of course.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Her:  \"Can you prove it?  Because if this parent comes after you with a lawyer, your butt is going to be in a sling.  It's not good when special ed kids fail.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The implication here being that my failing this kid was going to get me into trouble.  When you've got as many different kids with accommodations as I had, it's tough to document providing accommodations to every single kid, even when you're doing your best to do so.  The special ed teacher was trying to quietly leverage me into bumping Dave's grade up so she and I wouldn't have this headache to deal with.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me:  \"Mrs. Jones, I hear you loud and clear.  Let me tell you something.  I'm failing this kid because I feel that he lacks the understanding necessary to function as an adult in our society.  I'm failing him because it would be a shame if he left this school without even a rudimentary understanding of what this state considers to be mandatory subject matter.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Passing him would be the worst disservice I could do - because once he has that credit on his transcript, he can't come back and re-take this course.  So I'll be sending him out in the world unprepared with no way to recover.  This could affect him for life.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>And I'll do it in a heartbeat, Mrs. Jones.  I don't have the money to handle a protracted legal battle, and I can't risk my livelihood over one child.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>So you tell me when those lawyers are coming.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>And you tell me what grade you want on that kid's report card.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You want a 65?  You want a 75?  You want an 85?</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Tell me a number, I'll write it down and I'll forge the numbers.  I'll give this kid a 110 average in my class if it'll save my neck.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I'll cut his throat, and I'll send him out into the world ignorant and incapable.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Because my livelihood is more important to me than his future.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>What number would you like me write on his report card?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>She stood there with her mouth agape for a few seconds, then told me to have a good day.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I walked out, and started meticulously documenting everything having to do with this kid.  I went through is accommodation sheet, and made sure that each one was being met.  I e-mailed proof to his mother, weekly, of what I was doing to meet his accommodations.  I made copies of every accommodated assignment / every set of extra notes I made for him..  everything.  I printed out every e-mail I sent to the mother and highlighted it, color coding the highlighting to certain accommodations.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I volunteered to tutor the kid after school every day.  And when he didn't show up for first one excuse or another, I printed out his mother's excuses and quietly collected them in his file as well.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I had incontrovertible proof that I had done every single thing I could to meet this kid's needs, and every failure had to do with a lack of effort on his part or his mom's failure to bring him to tutoring.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Another teacher who has this same student comes to my classroom, shaking in his boots.  \"Mr. Deradius, I heard Dave's mother is going to mop the floor with us.  She works for the special ed department at her school, and she knows all the ins and outs.  She's going to come up here and put a blank special ed form in front of each of us and make us fill out Dave's accommodations from memory.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I stayed after school late that night memorizing his documentation.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>By the end of that evening, I could check every box if necessary and write his student ID in the student ID spot.  From memory.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Within a couple of days, I was called to a meeting.  I was ready for war.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>My position is that he's got his mother and the district wrapped around his finger.  He's learned he can manipulate the system so he doesn't have to do any work but passes anyway.  Which is great - but he's not learning anything.  My goal is for him to learn. Their goal is for him to pass.  If this kid is allowed to get away with this now, he's hosed down the road when he gets to the real world.  Your mom isn't going to set up a meeting with your boss about your accommodations.  You're just going to get fired for being lazy and ignorant.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I went to the meeting.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Around the table were the mother, the student, a member of the speical ed staff, the district special ed director, the assistant principal, and the assistant superintendent.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>They asked his first teacher,</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Mr. Smith, Dave is failing your class.  What have you done to meet Dave's accommodations?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mr. Smith stuttered and stammered.  \"Well, it's not that he - uh- it's not that I'm not doing me job.   He doesn't turn in any of his work, so - uh - he..\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"Mr. Smith, do you have any proof of this?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Mr. Smith gets quiet.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Next teacher, same thing.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Next teacher, same thing.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I'm sitting in the middle of the table with a stack of paperwork a foot high.  Proof that this kid is lazy, isn't doing his work, isn't doing what he needs to do.  All color coded, highlighted, and cross-referenced.   Several e-mails per week with the mother times about eighteen weeks or so - so about sixty or seventy e-mails.  For any given question they might ask me, I can instantly produce pages of documentation detailing how and why this kid is failing.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>They ask the teacher on my left a bunch of questions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>They ask the teacher on my right a bunch of questions.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>They never speak to me.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>At the end, I speak up.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\"I haven't been given the opportunity to speak, but I'm going to weigh in here.  Dave isn't failing because his needs aren't being met.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He's failing because he's lazy.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He's failing because he doesn't care.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>He's failing because he's figured out how to work the system.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>And if you have any question of that, I have record of every accommodation I've provided him going back for months.  I have given him every tool for success - and he has chosen failure at every turn.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The district special ed director said, \"Thank you Mr. Deradius.\" and the meeting adjourned.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>....</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Dave's grade in the other teacher's classes mysteriously improved after that meeting.   My guess is they had to bump his grade because they 'failed to meet his needs'.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>No one ever spoke to me about Dave.  A few days later an office runner showed up at my classroom door with a transfer paper for Dave.  I needed to sign it, because Dave was being transferred out of my class.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I went to the assistant principal, who had been in the meeting and knew of my frustration.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me:  \"If I don't sign this, what happens?\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Asst. Principal:  \"Dave gets moved anyway.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Me:  (Leaves the unsigned paper on her desk, returns to classroom)</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><em>Lesson learned:</em>  If you try to hold someone accountable for performance, they will simply go around you.  The goal is to get kids out - not to get them educated.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I've wrestled with myself over whether to put this edit up, but I've had a <em>lot</em> of people ask me about a book and encourage me to write one.  I thought it might be an effective way to get the word out to just <a href=\"http://www.schooledbook.com/\">leave this here</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62v2/?context=3","type":"X"}},

You could learn the cure for all diseases, then leave the recipe lying around hospitals with the ingredients ready to go. You could redistribute all of Earth's resources to those who need it most.

Please note that this advice is about an unavoidable physical confrontation with another unarmed person who <strong>intends to severely injure or kill you.</strong>  Always run and avoid a fight if you can. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Have to fight?  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I'm just going to assume this means you're cornered and 100% aware they're going to do harm to you and there's no other option and no one around to help.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>First thing to do before anything:  close your jaw.  Hold your teeth tight.  Do not let your jaw hang loose or you're leaving yourself extremely vulnerable.    A tight jaw fortifies your head from punches dramatically, only your nose and eyes are critical areas at that point.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rule 2:  keep your chin down.  Look up. Guard your throat with the positioning of your head.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rule 3: keep your feet solid on the ground.  No round house kicks or shit like that.  Never lose your footing.  Your feet placement may very well decide if you win or lose.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rule 4: NEVER do any stupid move that comes into your head where you go off your feet.  No rolling.  No trying to latch onto them like a monkey.  Do not get on your back. If any part of you but your feet is on the ground your losing chance flies up. <strong>Do not lose your footing.  FEET ON THE GROUND.</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rule 5: this fight won't last long.  Most don't.  Don't be trying to plan out some elaborate master plan.  From first strike to incapacitation of one side or both it's going to be like 15 second generously. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rule 6:  aim for squish, not bone.  Punching someone in the arm won't do anything if you're inexperienced which is what this is implying.   You strike their unprotected flesh that has organs or vital structures beneath it.  Punch them in the center of the abdomen and lift your fist at the end of the strike and one good hit like that will purge your opponent of stamina.  If you can, strike them in the neck, right where the Adam's apple is or should be.  Push the impact through as far as you can if you connect.  If this hit well you just ended the fight.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you punch at the face, aim for the nose.  Punch it up, not from the side.  But get whatever hits you can get.  This is just explaining ideal spots (tip: this fight won't be ideal.  None are.)</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rule 7:  Weight is king.  Not just in how much you weigh but how it's being distributed.  Getting ontop of someone and punching your weight down on them is substantially harder for them to defend against because their weight is dispersed across a supine position and yours is focused. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you get knocked down, get up ASAP.  If they get ontop of you guard your head and neck with your forearms.  I'm assuming this is a life or death situation.  Grab their forearm if you can when they swing another punch (you're about to break a rule to survive-and your About to get punched in the side of your head their free arm is on so get ready).  Bite their forearm as hard as you ducking can.  Underside of it preferably.  There is very soft flesh on the underside of the forearm and you can take a mouthful with you.  Bite deep enough and that hand will be weakened.   If your teeth haven't touched each other at the end of the bite keep biting down.  Don't let them get that arm back in one piece.  Don't try to bite off a finger or something. Don't let them put their hand in your mouth at all.  On the other side of things if they try to bite your hand shove your whole hand into their mouth and loosen your fingers till you touch the back of their throat and make a fist.  Beat them to death with your free hand now.  They're done. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Rule: 8  take any opportunity to flee.  The best way to fight is to not be in one.  There are so many things that can go wrong it's never the right option.  Flee. Run.  Shout. Get away. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>","footer":{"link":"https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5mdsbm/serious_if_a_physical_fight_is_inevitable_what/dc2yogi/?context=3","type":"X"}},
